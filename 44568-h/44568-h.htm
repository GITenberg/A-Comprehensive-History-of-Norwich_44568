v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> account of the sources of
information should be given in the preface to a history, in order
to assure the reader of the authenticity of the narrative.&nbsp;
No one can have turned over a bookseller&rsquo;s catalogue of
local historical publications without observing how few they are
in comparison with the extent and importance of the particular
district in view.&nbsp; The fact is, that most of the productions
of the early authors are either very scarce or are entirely out
of print.&nbsp; No city or county can boast of so many
industrious topographers and antiquarians as Norwich and
Norfolk.&nbsp; If we arrange them in alphabetical order, we
have:&mdash;Ames, Beatniffe, Blomefield, P. Browne, Brettingham,
Sir Thomas Browne, Chambers, Cory, Cotman, Dixon, Eldridge, Sir
Richard Elles, Forby, Sir John Fenn, Sir Andrew Fountaine, R.
Fitch, Gibson, Gillingwater, Hudson Gurney, Green, Gunn, Gurdon,
Harrod, Ives, Kent, J. Kirkpatrick, Le Neve, Lawrence, Mackerell,
Manship (both father and son), Marshall, Tom Martin, Matchett,
Neville, Nashe, Parkin, <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>Prideaux, Quarles, Richards, Sir H.
Spelman, Sir John Spelman, Clement Spelman, Swinden, Dawson
Turner, Wilkins, Watts, Wilkinson, and the Woodwards (father and
son).&nbsp; Most of these, however, were antiquarians, and
contributed more to arch&aelig;ology and topography than to
history.</p>
<p>Mr. J. Kirkpatrick, in the early part of the eighteenth
century, was the first who formed the plan of a regular
historical narrative.&nbsp; He spent the greater part of his life
in making researches and collecting materials for a history of
Norwich; and he wrote an immense quantity of matter in thick
folio volumes, the whole of which he left in MS. to the old
corporation.&nbsp; They comprised&mdash;</p>
<p>No. 1.&nbsp; A thick folio volume of the Early History and
Jurisdiction of the City; date 1720.</p>
<p>No. 2.&nbsp; A similar folio volume, being an account of the
Military State of the City, its walls, towers, ponds, pits,
wells, pumps, &amp;c.; date 1722.</p>
<p>No. 3.&nbsp; A thick quarto.</p>
<p>No. 4.&nbsp; Several large bundles, foolscap folio; Annals of
Norwich.</p>
<p>No. 5.&nbsp; A fasciculus, foolscap folio; Origin of
Charities, and Wills relating thereto, in each parish.</p>
<p>No. 6.&nbsp; Memorandum books of Monuments.</p>
<p>No. 7.&nbsp; Ditto of Merchants&rsquo; Marks.</p>
<p>No. 8.&nbsp; Ditto of Plans of Churches.</p>
<p>No. 9.&nbsp; Paper containing Drawings of the City Gates, and
a plan of Norwich.</p>
<p>No. 10.&nbsp; Drawings of all the Churches.</p>
<p><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>No.
11.&nbsp; An immense number of pieces of paper containing notes
of the tenure of each house in Norwich.</p>
<p>No. 12.&nbsp; A MS. quarto volume of 258 pages; the first
sixty devoted to notes upon the Castle at Norwich, the remainder
to an account of Religious Orders and Houses, and the Hospitals
of the City.</p>
<p>After the new corporation was constituted, all
Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s MSS. were dispersed into different
hands.&nbsp; The late Hudson Gurney, Esq., obtained possession of
some of them, and published a very limited number of copies of
those relating to the castle and to religious houses.&nbsp; Mr.
Dawson Turner edited the last-named MS. (No. 12), and it was
printed in 1845.&nbsp; He says that all the other MSS. had
disappeared, but that they were safe in the custody of the old
corporation, thirty years before (1815), when Mr. De Hague held
the office of town clerk.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mr. Kirkpatrick was the contemporary of the Rev.
F. Blomefield, the historian of Norfolk, who appreciated his
researches, and bore this testimony to his merits:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Kirkpatrick was a most laborious
antiquary and made great collections for the city of Norwich, of
which he published a large prospectus.&nbsp; In pursuing his
studies, he worked with Peter Le Neve, Norroy; and as they were
very intimate, they mutually exchanged their collections for this
place, Mr. Kirkpatrick giving all his draughts to Mr. Le Neve,
and Mr. Le Neve giving his to Mr. Kirkpatrick.&nbsp; To the
labours of both these gentlemen I am exceedingly obliged, and did
I not acknowledge my obligations in this public manner, I should
inwardly condemn myself as guilty of the highest
ingratitude.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>Mr.
Blomefield was, indeed, indebted to his deceased friend for the
most valuable parts of his History of Norwich, published in
1742.&nbsp; It is the only part of his work which can be properly
called history, the rest consisting of topographical descriptions
of different hundreds and parishes in Norfolk.&nbsp; Mr.
Blomefield began to print his &ldquo;History of Norfolk&rdquo; at
his own press in his own house at Fersfield, in 1739, by
subscription, and intended to publish a list of his subscribers
when the whole was finished.&nbsp; During his life the History
came out in monthly folio numbers; but he died when he had
proceeded as far as page 678 of the third volume.&nbsp; This
volume was completed by the Rev. Charles Parkin, rector of
Oxburgh, Suffolk; and after his death was printed in 1769 by
Whittingham, bookseller at Lynn, by whom the
&ldquo;Continuation&rdquo; was published in two more volumes in
1777, these two volumes being very inferior to the previous
three.&nbsp; Blomefield&rsquo;s work is of course the chief
source of information respecting Norwich, and it has been
republished in many abridged forms, the best edition being that
printed by J. Crouse for M. Booth, bookseller, in 1781, in ten
vols., the last relating to Norwich.&nbsp; Many smaller
abridgements have also been published, carrying on the narrative
to a later date.</p>
<p>The most reliable authority for the whole of the eighteenth
century is the &ldquo;Norfolk Remembrancer,&rdquo; compiled with
great care by Mr. Matchett.&nbsp; R. Fitch, Esq., published a
very full and accurate account of the Old Walls and Gates from J.
Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s MSS., illustrated with views by the late <a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>John
Ninham.&nbsp; B. B. Woodward, Esq., F.S.A., librarian of the
royal library at Windsor Castle, has also been a contributor to
the history of the old city, but as yet we have only brief
reports of his lectures &ldquo;On Norwich in the Olden
Time,&rdquo; as published in the local journals.&nbsp; He
directed attention to the purely fictitious accounts of the
origin of the city to be found in the early historians, who drew
in all good faith on their fertile imaginations.&nbsp; He gave a
much more probable account, and described the progress of the
city at different periods, as quoted in the following
pages.&nbsp; Mr. Harrod, too, has contributed a good deal to more
accurate views of early periods, especially in relation to the
earth-works of the castle, and to the monasteries.</p>
<p>The chapters on the &ldquo;Rise and Progress of Nonconformists
in Norwich&rdquo; in this history, are the first given in any
work of the kind, and supply information which will readily
account for the political condition of the city.&nbsp; From a few
hundreds in the seventeenth century, the Nonconformists have so
greatly increased that now they number many thousands, and have
at the same time attained to considerable wealth and
influence.</p>
<p>The chapters on Trade and Commerce supply a new feature in
Norwich history, and are very important to men of business.&nbsp;
The information on this head, including the history of the
Manufactures and of the Wholesale Trade of the city, is for the
most part taken from Essays, by the compiler, to which the prizes
were awarded at the Norwich Industrial Exhibition of 1867.</p>
<p><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>The great
length of the secular narrative must suffice as an apology for
the brevity of the ecclesiastical details, which occupy the
greater portion of Blomefield&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; A full history
of the churches in Norwich would fill many volumes; indeed,
Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s account of the Old Religious Houses occupies
as many as 300 pages.&nbsp; But the general reader would not be
interested by such details.</p>
<p>A full history of Norwich, up to the latest date, has long
been wanted, and the present compiler has availed himself of all
sources of information, but he has been obliged to compress a
great deal into a small compass.&nbsp; He has introduced many
notices of eminent citizens of every period, including bishops
and ministers of all denominations, who exercised much influence
in their day and generation.</p>
<p>Accurate views of local history afford the clearest insight
into the state of society at different periods.&nbsp; Thus the
records of Norwich Castle prove that nearly all the land in the
country was either assigned to bear, or was chargeable with, the
castle guard of some castle or other in ancient times.&nbsp; The
castles being fortresses were the centres around which large
towns arose, and where people most congregated for protection in
lawless ages.&nbsp; The whole island was one vast camp during the
feudal period.&nbsp; Monasteries were the only places of refuge
for travellers, or for the destitute poor, and when the religious
houses were dissolved, an entire change took place in the state
of society.</p>
<p>Local history, properly understood, is not a dry register of
events, but leads from particular conclusions to higher <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>generalisations.&nbsp; The predominance of certain ideas
at different times produced all the events of those
periods.&nbsp; Norwich men took an active part in all the great
movements of the day,&mdash;in the Reformation, the Civil Wars,
the Commonwealth, and all the agitations of more modern
times.&nbsp; Therefore, the story of the city is interesting and
important in every period, and it is identified with the whole
course of events in East Anglia.&nbsp; Indeed, it is difficult to
separate the history of Norwich, the capital of East Anglia, from
that of the whole district.</p>

<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>A SURVEY
OF NORWICH.</h2>
<h3>Rise and Progress of the City.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> tracing the rise and progress of
the city, it is necessary to inquire respecting the physical
condition of the district around it at an early period.&nbsp;
Before the dawn of authentic history, it is in vain to expect
full information on this point; but the natural changes that have
taken place may be traced with tolerable clearness.&nbsp;
Geologists inform us that the whole area of Norfolk, including
Norwich, was in remote ages under the sea; that by the slow
accumulation of alluvial matter islands were formed in this
estuary; and that the waters were divided into several
channels.</p>
<p>We may speculate as to the causes of these changes of the
level of land and water, but we cannot doubt the fact of such
changes having taken place.&nbsp; When or why the great body of
waters retired to its great reservoir in the bed of the ocean is
unknown; but whatever the causes, it is certain that between the
first <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and
the eleventh century the waters did gradually recede till the
river assumed a narrower appearance.&nbsp; The higher part of the
city from Ber Street up to Lakenham was probably, 2000 years ago,
like an island surrounded by water flowing up the valley of the
Taas on that side, and over the valley of the Wensum on the other
side.</p>
<p>The existence of Norwich as a city during the Roman period
from <span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span> 50 till <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 400 or 500 is very doubtful.&nbsp;
Camden says that its name occurs nowhere till the Danish
wars.&nbsp; If it did exist, it was only a fishing station, for
then a broad arm of the sea flowed up the valley of the Yare, and
covered a great part of the north side of the present city.&nbsp;
Indeed, for centuries after the Christian era this arm of the sea
may have flowed over the greater part of the ground on which the
north side of the city now stands.&nbsp; In the course of time,
however, the arm of the sea gradually silted up and left only the
present narrow river Wensum flowing into the Yare.</p>
<p>Tradition has handed down this couplet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Caister was a city when Norwich was
none,<br />
And Norwich was built of Caister stone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is, however, no evidence that Caister was ever more than
a village on the banks of the Taas, where the Romans built a camp
to overawe the neighbourhood; while all the old Roman roads have
always radiated from Norwich, proving that it was a place of
importance in the Roman period.&nbsp; The <i>Iceni</i> called it
<i>Caer Gwent</i>, altered by the Romans into <i>Venta</i>, so <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>that it was
the <i>Venta Icenorum</i> of the Romans, who probably threw up
the mound on which a castle was afterwards built, in the
Anglo-Saxon period.</p>
<p>Norwich very likely took its rise after the departure of the
Romans, about <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 418, on account
of the distracted state of the empire.&nbsp; Then, the camp or
station at Caister being almost deserted, the few remaining
Romans joined with the natives, and they became one people; and
the situation of Norwich being thought preferable to that of
Caister, many retired hither for the facility of fishing and the
easier communication with the country.&nbsp; Caister, however,
though almost deserted, kept up some reputation, till the river
becoming so shallow, cut off all intercourse with it by water and
reduced it to a place of no importance.</p>
<p>After the departure of the Romans, the Angles from the
opposite coast made themselves masters of this part of the
island, and to them is chiefly owing the further progress of the
city and its present name.&nbsp; &ldquo;Northwic&rdquo; signifies
a northern station on a winding river, and may have been so
called because of its being situated north of the ancient station
at Caister.</p>
<p>Norwich Castle was probably built in the reign of Uffa, the
first king of the East Angles, soon after the year 575.&nbsp;
About 642 it became a royal castle, and one of the seats of Anna,
king of the East Angles, whose daughter Ethelfred, on her
marriage with Tombert, a nobleman or prince of the Girvii (a
people inhabiting the fenny parts of Norfolk), had this Castle,
with the lands belonging to it, given her by her father.&nbsp; <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>About 677,
this Tombert and his wife granted to the monastery of Ely, which
they had founded, certain lands held of Norwich Castle, by Castle
guard, to which service they must have been liable before the
grant, for, by the laws of the Angles, lands granted to the
church were not liable to secular service, unless they were at
first subject thereto whilst in secular hands, which proves that
this was a Royal Castle in the time of King Anna.</p>
<p>The Danes soon came over in such large numbers and so
frequently, that they at last got possession of the whole of East
Anglia, and became the parent-stock of the inhabitants of parts
of Norfolk and Suffolk.&nbsp; In 1003, Sweyn or Swaine, King of
Denmark, came over with his forces and, in revenge for the
massacre of the Danes in the previous year, burnt Norwich and its
Castle, as well as many other places.&nbsp; They afterwards
rebuilt the city and castle, and came hither in such large
numbers, that Norwich became a Danish city, with a Danish Castle,
about 1011.&nbsp; After the restoration of the Anglo-Saxon
dynasty, the city entered on a new career of prosperity, and
according to the Domesday Book of Edward the Confessor, it
contained 25 churches, and 1320 burgesses, besides the serfs or
labourers.&nbsp; It was still the capital of East Anglia, with a
few hundred houses, but the greater part of the area round the
Castle presented only marshes and green fields.&nbsp; Two broad
arms of the sea still flowed up the valleys on each side of the
city.&nbsp; The whole district all around consisted of marsh, and
moor, and woods, and yet uncultivated land.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>In
1094, Herbert de Losinga, then Bishop of Thetford, removed the
See hither, and began to build the Cathedral, from which time the
city increased yearly in wealth and trade.&nbsp; Domesday Book
(1086) contains an account of all the lands and estates in
England, and also of all the towns.&nbsp; Norwich was then next
in size to York, and contained 738 families.&nbsp; Thetford had
at the same time 720 burgesses, and 224 houses empty.&nbsp;
Thetford, therefore, was decaying and Norwich was rising.&nbsp;
In 1377, a census was taken of several great towns in England,
and Norwich was found to contain 5300 people, for a migration
hither of Flemings and Walloons, who introduced the manufacture
of woollen and worstead fabrics, had increased the
population.&nbsp; In 1575, the muster roll of men delivered to
the government capable of bearing arms contained 2120 names,
which would be the proportion for 15,000 people.&nbsp; The
population in 1693 amounted to 28,881 inhabitants.&nbsp; In 1752
it had increased to 36,241, and in 1786 to 40,051.&nbsp; In 1801
it had decreased to 36,832.&nbsp; In 1811 the number was 37,256,
and during the next ten years so large was the increase that in
1821 the number was 50,288.&nbsp; In 1831, when the census was
taken, Norwich contained 61,116; in 1841, 61,796; in 1851,
68,713; in 1861, 74,414.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the continued succession of wars from the
revolution in 1688 to the conclusion of the peace in 1763, the
city continued to prosper, and its trade had become very great,
extending all over Europe, and Norwich manufactures were in
demand <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>in
every town on the continent.&nbsp; Indeed, the period of war,
from 1743 to 1763, was the most prosperous era in Norwich
history.&nbsp; The prosperity continued till the disputes arose
between the government and the North American colonies, which
commenced in 1765 and became serious in 1774, and were not
terminated till 1783, when the independence of the United States
was acknowledged.&nbsp; During this period, in fact, the trade of
the place was so good, that great numbers of people came from the
surrounding villages and obtained employment in the
factories.&nbsp; After the passing of the paving act in 1806, the
new paving of the city commenced, and proceeded very
slowly.&nbsp; This necessary work was interrupted at intervals
from the want of money, and the Commissioners got deep in
debt.&nbsp; In forty years they spent &pound;300,000, and left
Norwich the worst paved town in England.&nbsp; The drainage was
very defective, and the hamlets were not drained at all.&nbsp;
The supply of water was altogether insufficient, and in the
hamlets was obtained from wells.&nbsp; The Board of Health was
established in 1851, under the powers of the Public Health Acts,
and since then its provisions have been carried out.&nbsp; The
sanitary condition of Norwich has subsequently greatly improved
and the rate of mortality decreased, owing to the wise and
judicious measures which have been adopted of late years.&nbsp; A
fuller description of &ldquo;the Ancient City&rdquo; will be
found under the head of &ldquo;Norwich Antiquities.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>The
Modern City.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> modern city, with all its
improvements and extensions, presents a very different aspect to
what it did in former times, when it was enclosed by high walls
and gates.&nbsp; It stands for the most part on the summit and
sloping sides of a rising ground, running parallel with the river
Wensum on the southern side, above its confluence with the
Yare.&nbsp; Its greatest extent from St. Clement&rsquo;s Hill
(north) to Hartford Bridges (south) is four and a quarter miles;
and following the zigzag line of boundary it is about seventeen
miles in circumference, comprising 6630 acres of land.&nbsp;
Within its jurisdiction, as a city and a county of itself, it
includes the picturesque hamlets of Lakenham and Bracondale on
the south, of Catton on the north, of Thorpe on the east, and of
Heigham on the west, in which direction Norwich is rapidly
extending.</p>
<p>The city is situated in the eastern division of Norfolk, of
which county it is the capital.&nbsp; It is 20 miles distant from
the sea at Yarmouth, 108 miles distant from London, 42 from Lynn,
22 from Cromer, 43 from Ipswich, 72 from Cambridge, and 99 from
Lincoln; being in latitude 52&deg; 42&prime; N., and in longitude
1&deg; 20&prime; E of Greenwich.&nbsp; The Great Eastern Railway
system places it in communication with all the towns before
named, and all the large towns of England.&nbsp; There is a
railway station at Thorpe for the Norfolk <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>line from
Yarmouth to Ely, and another station at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Gates
for the Suffolk line from Norwich to Ipswich.&nbsp; Telegraphic
lines are established along both railways, and there is also
another line from London, vi&acirc; Norwich, to Cromer, on the
northern coast of the county.&nbsp; Navigation is carried on by
river from Norwich to Yarmouth.&nbsp; The Wensum, which rises at
Rudham, enters the city on the N.W., and leaves it on the
S.E.&nbsp; It pursues a boldly serpentine course through the
town, first traces for a short space the western limits, then
describes a semi-circle round the left bank, then winds through a
thinly-built part of the city, and next traverses a compact
eastern side.&nbsp; An eminence, that may be called a hill,
compared with the flatness of the surrounding country, extends
along the right bank of the river and terminates near its last
bend; and this eminence bears on its summit and its slopes all
the more ancient parts of the city, with a large portion of its
present streets and buildings.&nbsp; The outline of the area
within the old walls somewhat resembles the form of a cornucopia,
with the narrow end twisted round from the S. to the S.E., and
has been aptly compared to the figure of a haunch of
venison.&nbsp; A strong flint embattled wall, flanked with forty
towers, pierced by twelve beautiful gates, and fortified by a
broad ditch, formerly surrounded the city, except at two places,
where the Wensum formed a natural defence; but having fallen into
decay, and being considered a hindrance to the growth and
improvement of the town, it was stripped of all its gates, its
ditch was filled in, and the only portions <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>of walls
which were permitted to remain are a few strips, here and there,
of crazy ruin.&nbsp; The city inside the walls is divided into
thirty-five parishes, and has five more and parts of two others
within the county of the city.&nbsp; Altogether it contains forty
parish churches, exclusive of the Cathedral, the French and Dutch
Churches, and Christ&rsquo;s Church, New Catton; and upwards of
twenty Nonconformist chapels.&nbsp; It formerly included about
twenty other parishes, but they have been consolidated with some
of the present parishes, and the churches either desecrated or
taken down.&nbsp; Among the chapels which have altogether
disappeared may be mentioned the Chapel of St. Mary in the Field,
St. Catherine&rsquo;s Chapel, Hildebrand&rsquo;s Chapel, Magdalen
Chapel, St. Michael&rsquo;s Chapel, (Tombland), St.
Nicholas&rsquo;s Chapel, St. Olave&rsquo;s Chapel, (near King
Street gates), and others.</p>
<p>The older portion of the city in most of its street
arrangements is very irregular; and its thoroughfares are narrow
and winding, following in some instances the line of the ancient
walls.&nbsp; Some of its houses, however, are handsome
structures, and are often admired by strangers as beautiful
specimens of squared flint facings.&nbsp; The old street
architecture, however, is rapidly vanishing before the hand of
improvement.&nbsp; Many of the half-timber, lath and plaster
houses, remarkable for their grotesque gables and picturesque
appearance, have given place to plainer, but more comfortable and
convenient dwellings; some of which have handsome fronts, more
especially round the Market Place, and in the principal
streets.&nbsp; We may, <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>especially, notice the warehouses and
shops of Messrs. Chamberlin, Mr. G. L. Coleman, and others in the
Market Place; of Mr. Caley, Mr. Fiske, Mr. Livock, Mr. Dixon, Mr.
Sawyer, and Mr. Allen in London Street; the offices of the
National Provincial Bank in London Street; and of the Crown Bank
on the Castle Meadow.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Market Place</span>.</h3>
<p>The Market Place, which occupies the centre of the city, is
one of the most spacious in England; and being overhung by the
singularly massive square tower of St. Peter&rsquo;s, and
presenting several specimens of antique houses of the gable-front
construction, is very picturesque in its appearance.&nbsp; It was
formerly the great Croft, belonging to the Castle, on the outer
ditch of which it is supposed to have abutted.&nbsp; The first
parts built upon were the east and west sides and the north
end.&nbsp; The other portions were built by virtue of royal
licenses.&nbsp; As already indicated, it has been within the last
few years greatly improved, by the erection of new houses and
fronts; and upon the whole it may be said to be well
paved&mdash;though as regards the paving of the city generally,
there is still room for improvement.&nbsp; The approaches to the
Market Place, it should here be mentioned, were formerly very
narrow and difficult, and they are not even now all that could be
wished; but many improvements have nevertheless been made at very
great expense.&nbsp; Thus, London Street has within the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>last few
years been widened, at a cost of &pound;20,000; and Opie Street
has been opened from London Street to the Castle Hill.&nbsp; Of
course, the principal places of business are mostly clustered
together, either in the Market Place or in the nearest streets;
but in former times, every business in Norwich had its particular
row or station.&nbsp; Thus, in ancient deeds, we read of the
Glover&rsquo;s Row, Mercers Row, Spicer&rsquo;s Row,
Needler&rsquo;s Row, Tawer&rsquo;s Row, Ironmonger&rsquo;s Row;
also of the Apothecary&rsquo;s Market, the Herb Market, the
Poultry Market, the Bread Market, the Flesh Market, the Wool and
Sheep Market, the Fish Market, the Hay Market, the Wood Market,
the Cheese Market, the Leather Market, the Cloth-cutter&rsquo;s
Market, the White-ware Market; all of which we find mentioned
before the reign of Richard II.; for about the latter end of the
reign of Edward III., trades began to be mingled in such a
manner, that many of these names were lost.</p>

</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">High</span> over the centre of the old
city, over all its churches, and towers, and streets, rises the
Norman Castle, frowning in feudal grandeur over the whole
district.&nbsp; It stands on the summit of a mound or hill, steep
on all sides, which appears to be chiefly the work of nature,
with additions by human labour.&nbsp; The embattled quadrangular
keep, in its restored state, retaining all the details of
architectural decoration peculiar to the Norman style, presents a
faithful image, though without the grey antiquity, of its
original exterior, and is a noble striking object from whatsoever
point it is seen.&nbsp; The common history is, that a fortress
existed here during the Saxon period, and that Uffa, the first
King of the East Angles, formed one of earth, according to the
rude method of <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>the times.&nbsp; In 642, Anna, another of the East
Anglian kings, is said to have resided here; and during the
Danish wars, this fortress was often taken and retaken.&nbsp;
Alfred is believed to have repaired it, and to have erected the
first stone structure, which was destroyed by the Danes in
1004.&nbsp; Canute probably erected another castle here about
1018, and after the conquest it was much injured during a siege,
and was rebuilt by Roger Bigod.&nbsp; The plan of the
fortifications has been a subject of some controversy.&nbsp;
According to the account commonly given of the fortress, it
consisted of a barbican or outwork to defend the entrance; three
nearly concentric lines of defence, each consisting of a wall and
ditch, and enclosing a ballium or court; and a great central
keep, as the last resort in the event of a siege.&nbsp; The area
comprised a space of twenty-three acres, and each ditch had a
bridge over it similar to the one now remaining.&nbsp; The
barbican, or outwork of the fortification, was situated beyond
the outer ditch, if it ever existed.&nbsp; The wall commenced at
the opening called Orford Street, and gradually extended to the
end of Golden Ball Lane, the other extremity terminating in Buff
Coat Lane.&nbsp; The widest part is stated to have been forty
yards broad, and gradually decreasing at the extremities, the
length being about 220 yards.&nbsp; Part of the original form of
the wall was supposed to be traceable from the position of the
buildings erected on its site in Buff Coat Lane.&nbsp; The road
to the castle from Ber Street was supposed to pass through the
barbican, exactly where Golden Ball Lane recently stood.&nbsp;
The <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>circuits of the outer vallum and the middle vallum are
minutely described by most of the local historians; but
unfortunately there is no sufficient evidence in support of this
old theory of three ditches round the castle&mdash;nothing but a
vague traditional story, filled up by imagination.&nbsp; The
editors of the history published by Crouse in 1768, say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This castle was defended by a wall
surrounding it, built on the brow of the hill on which it stands,
and by three ditches; the outermost of which reached on the west
to the edge of the present Market Place, on the north to London
Lane, which it took in; on the east nearly to Conisford Street,
and on the south to the Golden Ball Lane.&nbsp; The postern or
back entrance into the works was on the north-east, by which a
communication was had with the earl&rsquo;s palace, then
occupying the whole space between the outer ditch and
Tombland.&nbsp; The grand entrance is on the south, from which
you passed three bridges in going to the Castle.&nbsp; The first
hath been immemorially destroyed; the ruins of the second
remained till the ditches were filled up and levelled thirty
years since; and the third still continues and consists of one
whole arch, exceeded by very few in England.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. John Kirkpatrick, who wrote an account of the Castle in
the last century, gives quite a different description of the
earth works.&nbsp; He notices the present ditch, and a second
entrenchment lying between the present ditch and the Shire house,
which then stood near the old weighing house on the hill.&nbsp;
He also refers to the Shire house ditch as a distinct <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>entrenchment.&nbsp; He describes a bridge house on the
inner side of the great southern ditch in the middle of the
present Cattle Market, and the line of the houses forming the
southern limit of the Cattle Market seems to show the limit of
the outwork.</p>
<p>Mr. B. B. Woodward, F.S.A., in his lectures delivered here on
&ldquo;Norwich in the Olden Time,&rdquo; adopted this view of the
earth works, which he believed did not consist of three
concentric lines of defence.&nbsp; He described the Saxon
fortress as probably no more than a strong palisade carried along
the inner edge of two great trenches and the top of the steep
bank of the small stream called the &ldquo;Cockey;&rdquo; the
buildings consisting of a great timber hall with offices and
stabling.&nbsp; He believed that the Normans strengthened the
outworks, cast up the great mound, dug the vast inner ditch, and
reared the noble donjon, which, before the
&ldquo;restoration&rdquo; of its exterior, was a fine feudal
monument.&nbsp; After the Norman period the earth works, Mr.
Woodward thought, underwent great changes.&nbsp; The horse-shoe
trench on the east side disappeared and was built upon.&nbsp;
This horse-shoe trench enclosed the Castle Meadow.&nbsp; Another
smaller outwork was formed on the south side of the original
great southern trench, both of the last named being crossed by
bridges.&nbsp; In support of this view, Mr. Woodward referred to
the account given by Kirkpatrick, who, as we have said, described
the second ditch as lying between the great circular ditch and
the Shire house, which then stood near the old weighing
house.&nbsp; The <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>old way from King Street had been disused because the
growth of the city had so greatly altered the defensive character
of the fortress.&nbsp; In addition to this, there were the names
of two churches, one of which was St. Martin&rsquo;s, (originally
called &ldquo;on the Hill,&rdquo;) but afterwards &ldquo;at
Bailey&rdquo; or &ldquo;at the Castle gate;&rdquo; and the other,
St. John, now Timberhill, but then &ldquo;at the Castle
gate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unless a way existed through the outworks to
the castle hill, these churches could not have been properly
called &ldquo;at the Castle gate;&rdquo; and as the
&ldquo;Bailey,&rdquo; was the space enclosed within the
intrenchments of the Castle, the other name of St. Martin would
be quite inappropriate.&nbsp; The Buckes, in their view of the
Castle, represented a ruined building, like a bridge house, on
the inner side of the great southern ditch.&nbsp; Before the end
of the last century, the level of the south side of the hill was
raised to form a Cattle Market.</p>
<p>Mr. Harrod, some years since, at a meeting of the
Arch&aelig;ological Society held in the Museum, exploded the
theory of three circular ditches by showing from the city records
that houses had always stood on the sites of the supposed outer
and middle ditches; the inner vallum was the only one, and
extended round the base of the hill on which the keep is erected,
and is plainly traceable at the present time.&nbsp; It is planted
with trees and shrubs, having a gravelled walk in the centre, and
is enclosed with an iron palisade.&nbsp; The area of the upper
ballium is level and comparatively high, and forms an irregular
circle on the summit of the hill, surrounded by an iron
railing.&nbsp; The great <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Keep situated within this area is a
massive quadrangular pile, 110 feet in length from east to west,
92 feet 10 inches in breadth from north to south, and 69&frac12;
feet high to the top of the merlons of the battlements, and the
walls are from 10 to 13 feet in thickness.&nbsp; From the
basement to the top are three stories, each strengthened by small
projecting buttresses, between which the walls are ornamented
with semi-circular arches resting on small three-quarter
columns.&nbsp; In the upper story the backs of some of these
arcades are decorated with a kind of reticulated work, formed by
the stones being laid diagonally, so that the joints resemble the
meshes of a net.&nbsp; To give it greater richness of effect,
each stone had two deeply chased lines, crossing each other
parallel with the joints, so as to present the appearance of
Mosaic.&nbsp; On the exterior of the west side are two arches
which appear to have been originally intended as a deception to
the enemy, giving an idea of weakness externally, where in fact
was the greatest strength; for the wall is not only 13 feet in
thickness in this place, but, within, it was additionally
barricaded by two oblique walls which were, long ago, taken
down.&nbsp; On the east side of the keep there is a projecting
tower called Bigod&rsquo;s tower, which was most probably built
by Hugh Bigod, third Earl of Norfolk, who succeeded his brother
as High Constable of the Castle, early in the 12th century.&nbsp;
This tower, which was an open portal to the grand entrance of the
Castle, is of a richer kind of architecture, and in the genuine
Norman style, and since 1824, has been entirely restored, so as
now to <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>exhibit its pristine aspect, which is certainly
different from the rest of the keep.&nbsp; The interior of the
keep has been so greatly altered in order to adapt it to prison
purposes, that the original arrangement of apartments cannot be
traced.</p>
<p>The style of architecture has been a matter of dispute, as to
whether it is Saxon, Danish, or Norman.&nbsp; Mr. Boid, in his
history and analysis of the principal styles of architecture,
ventures to challenge any one to prove the existence of any
monument in this country of real Saxon skill; nor has any
specimen been discovered.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins, of Norwich, who has
described both the ancient and modern states of the fortress in
Vol. xii. of the Arch&aelig;ologia, believed, however, that the
part which yet remains might have been constructed chiefly in the
reign of Canute, but that it is notwithstanding in the style of
architecture practised by the Saxons, long before England became
subject to the Danes, and is the best exterior specimen of the
kind.&nbsp; Other and later writers, with much better evidence,
believe the whole keep to be Norman, of the time of William
Rufus; for it is similar in style to Castle Rising, built in the
reign of that king, by Albini.&nbsp; The earth works and stone
works are very similar.&nbsp; The whole of the exterior of the
keep has been refaced, the original style being preserved.&nbsp;
It is to be regretted that the work was not wholly refaced with
small square stones, in the Norman manner, instead of commencing
with the large massive freestone, which is coloured to represent
smaller stones.&nbsp; This defect, however, on being discovered
was remedied, for <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>a great part of the exterior was finished after the
Norman fashion.&nbsp; The county jail stands on the east side of
the keep, and was built on the site of a previous prison in
1824&ndash;28 at a cost of &pound;15,000.&nbsp; It comprises a
governor&rsquo;s house and three radiating wings, and has room
for 224 male prisoners.&nbsp; Three bridges are, as we have said,
thought by some authorities to have crossed three ditches, but
for more than a century the present bridge has been the only
one.&nbsp; This bridge consists of one large semicircular
arch.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins supposed that it was the original bridge
built by the Saxons, but this is only conjectural like the rest
of his theory about the earth works.&nbsp; At the termination of
this bridge, upon the upper ballium, are the remains of two
circular towers, 14 feet in diameter, which are supposed to have
flanked the portal of the ballium wall.&nbsp; The history of the
castle will be given at some length in subsequent pages.&nbsp; We
shall now proceed to</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Cathedral</span>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> grand Norman pile is the great
ornament to the city, but its situation is so low that its goodly
proportions can be seen only from one point of view, namely from
Mousehold Heath.&nbsp; From that elevation it presents the
dignity of a great work of architecture, and the spire may be
seen on a clear day, on the north, at a distance of twenty
miles.&nbsp; The noble tower, with its gracefully tapering spire,
second in height only to that of Salisbury, the flying <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>buttresses,
and the circular chapels at the east end, are objects of interest
to the attentive antiquarian observer.</p>
<p>The cloisters on the south side, and the bishop&rsquo;s palace
and grounds on the north, and other premises, shut out from
public view most of the exterior, except the west front.&nbsp; A
fine view of the splendid effect, produced by a series of
unbroken lines, may be obtained opposite the south transept,
where the whole pile, comprising the transept, tower, and spire,
blend themselves into one harmonious whole.&nbsp; The interior
from the west front entrance presents a most imposing appearance,
and when surveying the vast length of the nave, we feel that our
forefathers</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Builded better than they knew,<br />
Unconscious stones to beauty grew.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We shall first give, in as complete a manner as our limited
space will permit, a sketch of the foundation and progress of the
edifice, the erection of which occupied a century, and then we
shall describe its different parts, exterior and interior,
including the nave, the screen, the choir, the transepts, and the
cloisters.</p>
<p>The original structure was begun in 1096 by Herbert de
Losinga, the first bishop of the diocese.&nbsp; The portions he
built comprise the choir, with the aisles surrounding it, the
chapels of Jesus and St. Luke, and the central tower with the
episcopal palace on the north side of the church, and a monastery
on the south.&nbsp; Bishop Eborard, the successor of Herbert, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>added the
nave and its two aisles, from the ante-choir or rood loft, to the
west end.&nbsp; The building, as left by Eborard, remained till
1171, when it sustained some damage by fire, but was repaired by
Bishop John de Oxford, about 1197, who also added some alms
houses to the monastery.&nbsp; The Lady chapel at the east end,
which has long since been destroyed, was the next addition to the
building, and was erected by Walter de Suffield, the tenth
bishop, who filled the See from 1244 to 1257.</p>
<p>In the year 1271, the tower was greatly injured by lightning
during divine service, and in 1272 the whole church was damaged
considerably, in the violent warfare which was at that time
carried on between the monks and the citizens; but in 1278,
having been repaired, the church was again consecrated by William
de Middleton on the day he was enthroned Bishop of Norwich, in
the presence of King Edward I. and Eleanor his queen, the Bishops
of London, Hereford, and Waterford, and many lords and
knights.&nbsp; We can now form no idea of the grandeur of such a
ceremony in that age.</p>
<p>The tower having been much injured and weakened by fire, a new
one, according to Blomefield, was begun and finished by Bishop
Ralph de Walpole; but this, says Britton, more properly applies
to the spire, the style of which, rather than of the tower,
corresponds with that period.&nbsp; Bishop Walpole ruled the
diocese from 1289 to 1299.&nbsp; Before his translation to Ely,
which took place in the latter year, he commenced the cloister at
the north-east angle, and built the <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>chapter house.&nbsp; He only
completed a small portion of the east aisles.&nbsp; The chapter
house has since been destroyed.&nbsp; The rest of the cloister
was built by Richarde de Uppenhall, Bishop Salmon, Henry de Will,
John de Hancock, Bishop Wakering, Jeffery, Symonds, and others,
and was completed <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1430, in the
133rd year from the first commencement of the work.</p>
<p>In January, 1362, the spire was blown down, and the choir
thereby much injured; but under the auspices of Bishop Percy, the
present spire was erected and the choir repaired.&nbsp; In 1629,
the upper part of the spire was again blown down, and in 1633, at
a general chapter, it was ordered to be repaired.&nbsp; In 1843,
seven feet were added to its elevation, with the present finial
which formed a consistent termination to the crockets.</p>
<p>In 1463, the church was much injured by fire, the wood work in
the interior of the tower having been ignited by lightning.&nbsp;
Under Bishop Lyhart, however, it was again repaired and
ornamented.&nbsp; The splendid stone roof of the nave was added,
the cathedral was paved, and a tomb was erected over the founder,
which was afterwards demolished during the great rebellion.&nbsp;
About the year 1488, Bishop Goldwell built the roof of the choir
of similar but inferior work to that of the nave, adding the
upper windows and flying buttresses.&nbsp; He also fitted up the
choir and the chapels around it, and covered the arched stone
work with lead.&nbsp; In 1509 the transepts having been much
injured by fire, Bishop Nykke repaired them, adding <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>stone roofs
to them in the same manner as the rest of the church.</p>
<p>At the dissolution of the monasteries, the cathedral suffered
greatly from the zeal of the Reformers, much curious work being
destroyed; and several obnoxious crucifixes, images, niches,
tabernacles, and paintings, were removed.&nbsp; In 1643, the
fanatics took possession of the church and the adjoining palace,
and plundered them of all that was valuable.&nbsp; The Yarmouth
people being in want of a workhouse, sent a petition to the Lord
Protector, praying that &ldquo;that great useless pile, the
cathedral, might be pulled down, and the stones given them to
build a workhouse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course the petition was not
granted.&nbsp; Soon after the restoration, the church was fitted
up again.&nbsp; In 1740, the nave and aisles were newly paved,
the tower was repaired, and the church cleaned.&nbsp; In 1763,
the floor of the choir was again repaved, the stalls repaired and
painted, and other improvements made, not always in harmony with
the original structure.</p>
<p>The edifice was extended, embellished, altered, and repaired
by many bishops and by wealthy families till it was completed
about 1500.&nbsp; Alternate dilapidations and restorations
followed.&nbsp; The dilapidations were sometimes sudden,
sometimes gradual, and the restorations have continued at
frequent intervals almost to the present day.&nbsp; The entire
pile was repaired and beautified on an extensive scale in
1806&ndash;7.&nbsp; The decayed ornaments of the west front were
restored, and many improvements in other parts were effected in
1818 and following years.&nbsp; The south front was <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>renovated,
and several houses which had stood against the walls were removed
in 1831.&nbsp; The entire fabric was again restored, on the plan
of Edward Blore, about 1840&ndash;3; and some portions were
repaired, some embellishments were added, and some interesting
ancient features were brought into view between the years 1843
and 1868.</p>
<p>The pile as it now stands, comprises a nave of fourteen bays
with aisles, a transept of three bays in each wing, a central
tower, a steeple, an apsidal sacristy on the north-east side, a
choir of four bays with aisles, an apsidal end, and a procession
path; also three chapels, in the south side, the north-east side,
and south-east side; and a cloister with each alley of eleven
panes to the south of the nave.&nbsp; The dimensions of the
Cathedral as taken from actual measurement are as

<h4><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span><i>The
Interior</i>.</h4>
<p>We shall now proceed with our description of the interior,
which contains the finest specimens of Norman architecture in
existence, and admired by all men of taste.&nbsp; Nothing can
exceed the grandeur of the lofty nave, massive columns, and wide
circular arches.&nbsp; The whole pile is chiefly of the early
Norman style, wherein the semi-circular arches and massive short
columns are the leading features.&nbsp; These are considerably
varied in size, moulding, and ornament, in different parts of the
edifice.</p>
<p>The Nave comprises fourteen semicircular arches, ornamented
with billet and zigzag mouldings, and supported by massive
piers.&nbsp; The arches of the triforium are of similar style to
those below.&nbsp; The magnificent roof, the work of Bishop
Lyhart, the rebus of whose name is of frequent occurrence upon
the vault and corbels, is ornamented with 328 historical figures,
curiously carved, in a kind of relievo peculiar to itself, being
chiefly composed of little figures, most exactly put together,
said to be the only work of the kind in existence, being a
complete chain of sacred history, beginning at the tower with the
Creation of the World; the different days of the creation being
disposed of in the several figures in the intersections of the
arched work of the roof.&nbsp; The Fall of Man, Noah&rsquo;s Ark,
and incidents in the lives of the patriarchs, are represented in
the first seven arches; the rest to the west end represent events
narrated in the New Testament.&nbsp; The interior of the <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>nave looks
much too long in proportion to the rest of the pile, and the
triforium is out of keeping in consequence of its heavy circular
arches being too high as compared with those of the tier below,
but the piers of the nave, with the grand arches which they
support, are splendid specimens of Norman work and
decoration.</p>
<p>The south transept is Norman work modified by a few
innovations, and is flanked by square turrets, arcaded at the top
and terminating in pinnacles.&nbsp; The north transept is of
similar character.&nbsp; The side aisles are low, and the roof of
plain vaulting.&nbsp; The west window is of unusually large size,
and is of the same design, as regards the tracery, with that in
Westminster Hall.&nbsp; This window has been filled in with
gorgeously coloured glass, being designed as a memorial of Bishop
Stanley, who was buried in the middle of the nave.</p>
<p>In the seventh arch of the north side are the remains of a
doorway, with a stone bench, formerly leading into the
monks&rsquo; preaching yard, now part of the bishop&rsquo;s
garden.&nbsp; Even after the Reformation, and up to the time of
the great rebellion, sermons were preached here before the Civic
Authorities and the Members of the Cathedral.&nbsp; Between the
sixth and seventh pillars is an unpretending inscription to the
memory of the learned Dr. Prideaux, formerly Dean of Norwich,
author of the &ldquo;Connection of the Old and New
Testaments,&rdquo; who died November 1st, 1724.&nbsp; The tomb
between the corresponding pillars on the opposite side is that of
Miles Spencer, Chancellor of the <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Diocese in 1537.&nbsp; Between the
seventh and eighth pillars is the low tomb of Bishop Nykke, who
died in 1535.&nbsp; At the eighth pillar a pulpit formerly
stood.&nbsp; Bishop Parkhurst&rsquo;s tomb stands in the next
space, between the eighth and ninth pillars.</p>
<p>The Screen was originally the division between the rood-loft
and the chapel of our Lady of Pity.&nbsp; Bishop Lyhart erected
the rood-loft, and upon it the principal rood or cross was placed
with the representation of the Holy Trinity, to whom this church
was dedicated; together with the images of the Blessed Virgin and
St. John, and such other saints as were esteemed here.&nbsp; The
rood or crucifix, of full proportions, was made of wood, and in
most churches was placed in a loft constructed for the purpose
over the entrance from the church into the chancel.&nbsp; The
nave represented the Church Militant, and the chancel the Church
Triumphant.&nbsp; Those, therefore, who would pass out of the
former into the latter, must go under the loft; that is, must go
under the cross and suffer affliction.&nbsp; But no rood was
complete without the images of the Virgin and St. John on either
side of the cross, in allusion to St. John xix.
26,&mdash;&ldquo;Jesus saw His mother and the disciple standing
by, whom He loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Choir contains sixty-two stalls according to the number of
the old foundations, namely, a prior, sub-prior, and sixty
monks.&nbsp; They are adorned with rich and quaint carvings and
canopies, as far as the west pillars of the tower.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;misereres&rdquo; (projecting brackets on the under side of
the seats of <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>stalls in churches), are richly carved and present a
great variety of design.&nbsp; Among the stalls the Rev. R. Hart
discovered upwards of sixty <i>misereres</i>, and he described
them very minutely.&nbsp; In every example that he had seen the
space under the ledge is carved in a bold relief, with an
ornamented boss on each side to balance, as it were, the centre,
whatever it might have been.&nbsp; As may be supposed scriptural
or legendary designs are not often found in such a
position.&nbsp; There are, however, a few examples.</p>
<p>The interior of the tower, which is raised on four massive
arches, presents three arcades, the upper and lower forming
galleries, and the former containing the lower windows of the
lantern, which are filled with painted glass.&nbsp; The
clerestory and roof of the chancel are the work of Bishop
Goldwell.&nbsp; Here is an admirable specimen of engrafting a
later style upon the Norman architecture, with as little violence
to the eye as possible.</p>
<p>The tomb of Bishop Goldwell stands within the chapel, formerly
dedicated to St. James, and with its canopy forms a rich specimen
of ornamental sculpture and architecture.&nbsp; On the east side
of the fifteenth north pillar is the monument to the memory of
the learned Bishop Home, author of an excellent
&ldquo;Introduction to the Study of the Bible.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
the space between the seventeenth and eighteenth pillars was the
chapel dedicated to St. Anne, and in the next space was the seat
occupied by Queen Elizabeth, when she attended divine service
during her visit to this city.&nbsp; The monument to the late
Bishop Bathurst <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>now occupies the spot, a sitting statue sculptured in
white marble.&nbsp; Not only for its intrinsic merits is this
statue of great value, but also because it is the last finished
work of Sir Francis Chantrey, who visited Norwich for the purpose
of fixing it only a few days before his death.&nbsp; Opposite to
this monument is the altar tomb of Sir William Boleyn, now
despoiled of its brasses.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Browne tells us in his
&ldquo;Repertorium,&rdquo; that, during the Commonwealth,
&ldquo;more that a hundred&rdquo; brasses were reeved in the
Cathedral alone,&mdash;a greater number than the whole county of
Norfolk could now supply.&nbsp; Hence our readers may easily
understand what an immense number of these interesting memorials
must have been lost, independently of the number that have been
partially despoiled by the removal of their canopies.</p>
<p>At the foot of the altar steps, in the middle of the chancel,
is the tomb of Bishop Herbert de Losinga, erected by the Dean and
Chapter, in 1682, in the place of one destroyed during the civil
wars.&nbsp; It has been levelled with the pavement and presents a
long Latin inscription from the pen of Dean Prideaux.&nbsp; The
east windows of the clerestory were the gift of the Bishop, the
Misses Morse, and the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral, and were
erected between 1840 and 1847.&nbsp; The lower one in the
triforium is an obituary window to the memory of the late Canon
Thurlow, placed there by his friends.&nbsp; This space had before
been occupied by a window with a pointed arch, representing the
Transfiguration.&nbsp; The window was removed to the south
transept, and the arches of both windows have been restored.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>The
bishop&rsquo;s throne, ascended by three steps, was originally
placed at the east end of the church, behind the altar, and
raised so high that before the partition was made between the
altar and the entrance to Our Lady&rsquo;s chapel, the bishop had
an uninterrupted view from his throne directly in a line through
the whole church.&nbsp; The custos, or master of the high altar,
annually accounted for the offerings made there, which produced a
large sum; and at the annual processions of the city and country
clergy, on the feasts of the Holy Trinity and St. Paul, something
considerable was realized.</p>
<p>The stone roof of the south transept, as well as that of the
north, was raised by Bishop Nykke, about 1501.&nbsp; At the same
time, probably, the old Norman arch leading into the chancel
aisle was filled with the rich and numerous mullions and tracery,
which characterise the last period of pointed architecture.&nbsp;
The adjoining aisle leads to the chapel of our Lady the Less,
otherwise called Bawchyn&rsquo;s Chapel, having been dedicated to
the Virgin and all the Saints, by William de Bawchyn, about the
middle of the fourteenth century.&nbsp; The founder is buried in
an arched vault under the chapel.&nbsp; This chapel is now used
as the Consistory Court.&nbsp; Adjoining is St. Luke&rsquo;s
Chapel, sometimes used as the parish church of St. Mary in the
Marsh, that church having been demolished.&nbsp; Strictly
speaking, the circular part only is the chapel dedicated to St.
Luke, but the adjoining aisle, as far as the most eastward point,
is now enclosed and fitted up for the use of the parish.&nbsp; It
is part of Bishop <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Herbert&rsquo;s original foundation.&nbsp; The font was
brought from the parish church; it is richly carved with designs
of the seven sacraments, &amp;c.&nbsp; Passing round at the back
of the altar we come to the Jesus Chapel.</p>
<p>The north transept is similar to the south.&nbsp; From the
east wall of it there was a doorway leading to a chapel, said to
be the ancient Vestiary.&nbsp; The arch has been filled up, and
the entrance is from a small door on the outside.&nbsp; Over the
exterior of the door leading to the Bishop&rsquo;s palace is a
niche, containing a figure, said to represent Bishop Herbert, one
of the few specimens extant of a Norman statue.</p>
<h4><i>The Exterior</i>.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> exterior of the Cathedral is
not very imposing.&nbsp; The west front was the work of Bishop
Alnwick, in the reign of Henry VI.&nbsp; It is divided into three
compartments, forming the termination of the nave and the
aisles.&nbsp; The central division presents the grand entrance
doorway, and a large central window filled with coloured glass,
which we have already described.&nbsp; It rises into a gable,
formerly pierced with a small light, now a niche, flanked by two
turrets with spirelets and round-headed single panels, and
surmounted by a cross.&nbsp; The doorway is formed by a bold
deep-pointed arch, and is much enriched in the spandrels and side
fasci&aelig; with mouldings, niches, pedestals, statues, and
other decorations.&nbsp; The central window is divided, both
horizontally and <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>vertically, into three leading compartments, and
subdivided by small mullions; and has good decorations of
perpendicular character.&nbsp; Each of the two lateral divisions
of the west front exhibits pure Norman work, and is of three
stories; the first pierced with the doorway; the second pierced
with four windows separated only by small columns; the third
displaying three blank arches, and flanked with a small staircase
turret.&nbsp; At each side of the great window, and at the
extremities of the side divisions, are Norman turrets, lately
restored and substituted for very debased cupolas.&nbsp;
Engravings are extant representing this front with high and
slender pinnacles where the Norman turrets now stand.</p>
<p>The north and south elevations of the nave show a
three-storied aisle; and a clerestory and triforium, with an
embattled parapet in each, exhibit a great height, and tiers of
blank arches or arcades with some later perpendicular
windows.&nbsp; On the exterior of the nave will be observed many
traces of alterations in times long subsequent to the original
building.&nbsp; The lowest tiers of windows are of comparatively
modern insertion, and intersect the string course of a billet
moulding, all round the exterior of the edifice.&nbsp; Next above
is the arcade of blank arches, with semicircular mouldings,
having regular bases and capitals, and continuing round the whole
structure.&nbsp; Above these was the tier of original windows now
closed up, but surmounted by windows of the sixteenth
century.&nbsp; The exterior of the side aisles is here terminated
by a plain embattled parapet of the same date as the <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>windows
before mentioned.&nbsp; The windows of the clerestory are,
however, Norman, and have blank arches on each side, and continue
the same all round the upper part of the nave and transept.&nbsp;
They are surmounted by a parapet similar to that of the side
aisles.&nbsp; The exterior of the south transept has been lately
restored, and various old houses that blocked up the entrance
have been cleared away.</p>
<p>The tower is grandly Norman in four stages, each adorned with
arcades, columns, and tracery mouldings.&nbsp; It has, at the
corners, square turrets with their angles cut off, and is
surmounted by decorated battlements and crocketted
pinnacles.&nbsp; The spire is decorated English octangular,
elegantly proportioned, enriched with bands, and boldly
crocketted in ribs running up its angles.&nbsp; It terminates in
a handsome finial, and is the loftiest in England except that of
Salisbury.&nbsp; The base of the spire is supported by projecting
buttresses at each angle, terminating in a small pinnacle.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Cloisters</span>.</h4>
<p>The Cloisters, which are entered by a tasteful modern door on
the south side of the nave, form one of the most beautiful
quadrangles in England.&nbsp; They comprise a square of about 174
feet, and are 12 feet wide.&nbsp; They were commenced by Bishop
Walpole about 1297, but were not completed by succeeding prelates
till 1430.&nbsp; The style of architecture is the decorated, with
traces of the perpendicular.&nbsp; The <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>eastern part is the most ancient, and
a progressive change may be observed in the tracery of the
windows, commencing at the north-east corner, continuing through
the south and the west, and terminating with the north
sides.&nbsp; The roof is much admired for its exquisitely
beautiful groining, and its bold yet elegant bosses, with their
sculptured subjects and tasteful foliage.&nbsp; The doorway
leading from the eastern aisle of the cloisters to the nave is
deserving especial notice, being a pointed arch with four columns
on each side, having archwolt mouldings, in front of which are
seven canopied niches, with richly-sculptured crockets containing
figures.&nbsp; Above the door, at the south-west corner, are
carved figures of &ldquo;The Temptation of our First
Parents.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the first two arches on the west side of
the door are two lavatories, where the monks used to wash their
hands before going into the refectory or common eating
hall.&nbsp; Over each of these are three niches, where images
formerly stood.&nbsp; The cloisters are surpassed by none in
beauty of architecture and solemnity of effect.&nbsp; They branch
off from the south transept, and enclose a square court or
area.&nbsp; There are eleven noble windows or arched openings on
the western side, twelve on the east, eleven on the north, and
eleven on the south.&nbsp; All these windows are divided into
three lights by two columns, and are decorated with a variety of
beautiful tracery.&nbsp; They are of decorated architecture,
except eight on the north side, which have perpendicular tracery
in decorated arches.&nbsp; The upper portion of the tracery of
all the windows appears to have been once filled with stained
glass.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>The
pavement of the north side of the cloisters was torn up in the
great rebellion, and relaid by William Burleigh, Esq.&nbsp; In
this alley Queen Elizabeth dined in public when she visited
Norwich in 1578.&nbsp; In memory thereof, her Majesty&rsquo;s
arms and those of the nobility who attended her were painted on
the wall of the church, and properly blazoned with supporters,
etc., but they were entirely effaced a century ago.</p>
<p>The dormitory of the monks adjoined the cloisters on the
south.&nbsp; At a short distance from the cloisters are the only
remains of the Priory founded by Bishop Herbert, consisting of
three massive clustered columns, the capitals of which are
curiously carved.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Bishop&rsquo;s Palace</span>.</h4>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s Palace stands on the north side of the
Cathedral Church, to which there was in former times a passage
from the door of the north transept, arched over with stone
similar to the cloisters.&nbsp; The original palace was founded
by Bishop Herbert, but has undergone so many repairs and
alterations, that but little of the first building remains, and
that part adjoins a new structure, in a similar style of
architecture.&nbsp; In the garden there is a fine ruin, said to
be remains of the grand entrance into the great hall, which
reached to the site of the present episcopal chapel, and was 110
feet long, and 60 broad.&nbsp; This chapel was restored in 1662,
and in it are monuments of Bishops Reynolds and Sparrow.&nbsp;
The entrance to the episcopal residence is from St.
Martin&rsquo;s Plain, by the palace gate, built by <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Bishop
Alnwyck about 1430.&nbsp; It has a large pointed arch of several
mouldings, and the spandrels are filled with tracery; but it has
suffered materially from injudicious repairs.&nbsp; Over the arch
is a series of pannelled compartments with the letter M
crowned.&nbsp; On the west side is a small door, on which,
amongst other ornaments, are a heart and mitre, the supposed
rebus of Bishop Lyhart.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Cathedral Precincts</span>.</h4>
<p>The Cathedral Precincts include the Upper and Lower Close, and
a large portion of garden ground, with good houses on the south
side.&nbsp; The Upper Close was formerly used as a play ground to
the Grammar School; it is now enclosed with palisades.&nbsp; At
the south-east corner is the Audit Room, which contains the
library of the Dean and Chapter.&nbsp; The Lower Close was
enclosed by Dean Lloyd, in 1782, and converted into a
garden.&nbsp; At the extremity of the Lower Close, near the edge
of the river, still stands a double arch of black flint, which is
considered the roughest bit of picturesque in Norwich, and has
been frequently sketched.&nbsp; It was formerly the Water-gate to
the precincts, and is now known as &ldquo;Pull&rsquo;s
Ferry.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span><span
class="smcap">The Free Grammar School</span>.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p45b.jpg">
<img alt=

"The Free Grammar School"
src="images/p45s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Free Grammar School, near the west end of the Cathedral,
was founded by Bishop Salmon, in 1325, and annexed to a small
Collegiate Chantry.&nbsp; At the dissolution of this college, the
Corporation, by their Hospital Charter, were required to find a
master and usher, and to remunerate them out of the ample
revenues assigned to them by that charter.&nbsp; This trust was
transferred, in 1836, from the Corporation to the Charity
Trustees.&nbsp; There are generally a little more than a hundred
pupils at the school.&nbsp; The celebrated Dr. Valpy was once the
head-master; and in addition to many eminent scholars, the
celebrated &ldquo;Norfolk hero,&rdquo; Lord Nelson; Sir James
Brooke, the Rajah of Sarawak; and other noted characters, were
educated here.&nbsp; Opposite the school is a colossal marble
statue of Nelson.&nbsp; It was executed by Mr. Milne, of London,
and has been highly commended <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>as a work of art.&nbsp; Of this
school, and also of the Commercial School, which is under the
same trust, we shall have more to say in subsequent pages.</p>
<p>The Gateways to the Cathedral on the west side are deserving
of notice.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Erpingham Gate</span></h3>
<p>is situated directly before the west front of the Cathedral,
and is in an excellent state of preservation.&nbsp; It was built
in 1428 by Sir Thomas Erpingham, (who lies buried in the choir of
the Cathedral) as a penance for having espoused the cause of
Wickliffe.&nbsp; It consists of a lofty pointed arch, in the
mouldings of which are a series of thirty-eight statues in
canopied niches.&nbsp; The spandrels are highly decorated with
tracery mouldings and shields, the whole being enclosed in a kind
of square frame with semi-circular buttresses, each of which is
divided into four compartments with statues, niches, pedestals,
and shields.&nbsp; As a matter of some interest, it may here be
mentioned that over against the front of this gate is a large
block of buildings, enclosing what is commonly called Sampson and
Hercules&rsquo; Court.&nbsp; The grotesque wood figures, designed
to represent these personages, formerly supported the portico,
but are now placed in the paved court.&nbsp; The one holds a
club, and the other the jawbone of an ass.&nbsp; The house itself
was formerly owned by Sir John Fastolf, and afterwards by the
Countess of Lincoln; and in the time of Henry VII. by Elizabeth
Duchess of Suffolk, who used it as a city <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>house for
herself and family.&nbsp; It is now in the occupation of Messrs.
Pratt and Hancock, wholesale grocers and cheese factors, who have
covered in the whole court.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Ethelbert Gateway</span></h3>
<p>leads to the south end of the Upper Close.&nbsp; It was built
by the citizens as an atonement for the injuries done in a
quarrel which they had with the monks in 1272.&nbsp; The chamber
over the arch was formerly used as a chapel dedicated to St.
Ethelbert, the church of that name having been destroyed during
the riots.&nbsp; The west front has a modern pediment of stone
tracery, inlaid with flint.&nbsp; Beneath is a series of blank
niches with a statue in the centre.&nbsp; In the spandrels of the
arch are figures, in basso relievo, of a man with a sword and
round shield attacking a dragon.&nbsp; The east front consists of
stone tracery and flint with painted windows.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The View from the Castle
Hill</span>.</h3>
<p>We shall now return to the Castle-hill Walk, which is
favourable for a view of the whole city, with all its churches
and towers.&nbsp; If we take our position on the eastern side we
shall see the broad vale of the Yare, where the Romans came up in
their galleys and landed on that side of the river, then very
wide.&nbsp; We shall see also where the first street (King
Street,) extends southward the whole length of the city, with
tall chimnies of great breweries sending forth volumes <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>of
smoke.&nbsp; Northward the same street extends to an open space
called Tombland; beyond which, Wensum Street and Magdalen Street
lead in a straight line to Catton and the village of
Sprowston.&nbsp; The circle of vision includes the Cathedral, the
Grammar School, St. Helen&rsquo;s Church, Mousehold Heath,
Kett&rsquo;s Castle, Lollards&rsquo; Pit, the hamlet of Thorpe,
the churches of St. Peter per Mountergate, St. Julian, and St.
Peter Southgate, in King Street.&nbsp; Walking round to the west
side, we have before us the spacious Market Place, and the noble
church of St. Peter Mancroft, with a mass of buildings.&nbsp;
From the Market Place we see several lines of streets running in
a direction from east to west; Bethel Street, leading to St.
Giles&rsquo; Church, and St. Giles&rsquo; Street, in a straight
line to Heigham.&nbsp; Here in the foreground, the Guildhall is a
conspicuous object.&nbsp; More on the right we have London
Street, Prince&rsquo;s Street, St. Andrew&rsquo;s Street,
Pottergate Street, and St. Benedict&rsquo;s Street, running in
lines from east to west.&nbsp; Here, the chief objects are the
churches of St. John&rsquo;s Maddermarket and St. Gregory; and in
the distance, St. Lawrence, St. Margaret&rsquo;s, and St.
Michael&rsquo;s at Coslany.&nbsp; From the north side of the
Castle walk we see Exchange Street, Post Office Street leading
into St. Andrew&rsquo;s, and St. George&rsquo;s Street, Pitt
Street, and St. Augustine&rsquo;s, and St. Martin&rsquo;s at Oak,
all the lower parts of the town, full of close narrow streets,
yards, and courts.&nbsp; The principal objects in view are St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, the churches of St. Martin at Oak, St. Mary,
St. Augustine, St. George&rsquo;s Colegate, St. Saviour, St. <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Clement, St.
Peter Hungate, St. Michael at Plea, St. Paul, St. Simon and Jude,
St. Edmund, and St. George Tombland.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Cattle Market</span>.</h3>
<p>The Cattle Market, on the south side of the hill, has been
greatly extended, and presents the most extensive area for the
purpose in England.&nbsp; On the east side whole blocks of old
houses have been cleared away, and great additions made to the
space for the display of horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs.&nbsp;
The improvements cost the city over &pound;50,000.&nbsp; Every
Saturday the hill presents a busy and highly interesting scene,
and a vast amount of business is transacted here in the space of
a few hours.&nbsp; The area has recently been further enlarged by
the demolition of some old houses at the corner of Golden Ball
Street.&nbsp; A line of new houses has been built on the east
side, ending with the handsome show rooms of Messrs. Holmes and
Sons, the well-known Agricultural Machine Makers, who have won
many prizes for their implements.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Shirehall</span>.</h3>
<p>The Shirehall, on the Castle Meadow, was erected from a plan
by William Wilkins, Esq.&nbsp; It was commenced on September 9th,
1822, and opened September 27th, 1823, and is a poor imitation of
the Tudor style of architecture.&nbsp; It stands on the
north-east side of the Castle, and is a substantial brick
edifice, <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>possessing all the usual accommodations.&nbsp; It
comprises Crown Court, Nisi Prius Court, and rooms for witnesses
and others.&nbsp; The county assizes and sessions are held in
these courts.&nbsp; Near the crown court there is a small room
communicating, by a shaft, with the prison above, whence
prisoners are brought down for trial.&nbsp; The grand Jury room
is a large apartment, and the walls are adorned with fine
portraits of the late Lord Wodehouse and the late Earl of
Leicester, painted by Sir T. Lawrence.&nbsp; There is also a
portrait of the late Henry Dover, Esq., for many years Chairman
at Quarter Sessions.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Guildhall</span>.</h3>
<p>The Guildhall is a large antique building, chiefly of flint,
at the north end of the Market Place.&nbsp; It was completed in
1413, when the windows of the Council Chamber were glazed chiefly
with stained glass; but all these ornaments have disappeared,
except in three east windows.&nbsp; The furniture of this room is
of the time of Henry VIII., and the wood work is ornamented with
the linen pattern.&nbsp; The room has been much improved of late
years.&nbsp; The principal court is on the ground floor, where
the city assizes and sessions are held.&nbsp; The Police Court is
in a room above, opposite the Council Chamber.&nbsp; The Town
Clerk and City Treasurer have offices in the building.&nbsp; The
Police Station is on the ground floor of the east side.</p>
<p>The interior of the hall is decorated with portraits, some
interesting trophies of the battle of St. Vincent, <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>presented by
Nelson, the city regalia, and the buskins of a famous dancer, who
danced from London to Norwich in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth.&nbsp; When that Queen visited the city in 1578, there
was a magnificent banquet given in the Council Chamber, and a
pageant devised for her amusement was exhibited.&nbsp; In one of
the cells at the bottom of the building, the martyr Thomas Bilney
was confined, and there tested his powers of endurance by holding
his finger in the lighted flame of a candle, to prove his
willingness to suffer his approaching doom.&nbsp; In 1660, the
lower court at the west end, now used as an assize court, was set
apart as a cloth hall, and the room above as a place for the sale
of yarn.&nbsp; During the present century the hall has been much
improved on the south side.&nbsp; New windows should be inserted
on the north side.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall</span>.</h3>
<p>St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall stands in the centre of the city, in
the parish of St. Andrew.&nbsp; It was originally the Church of
the Convent of the Blackfriars, the building of which was begun
about the year 1415, by Sir Thomas Erpingham, who died in 1428,
before it was finished.&nbsp; It was completed by his son, Sir
Robert Erpingham, who was rector of Bracon Ash, in Norfolk, a
friar of the order of St. Dominic, and a member of this
convent.&nbsp; This convent extended from St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Street to the river from south to north, and as far as Elm Hill
on the east.&nbsp; The cloister was on the north side of the
church, with a burial place in the middle.&nbsp; <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>The convent
kitchen was at the north-west corner.&nbsp; Between the nave and
choir of the church there was a neat sexangular steeple, which
had three large bells in it and a clock.&nbsp; It was built about
1462, and fell down on November 6th, 1712.&nbsp; A turret was
afterwards erected in its place, in which a clock bell
hung.&nbsp; At the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538, the
citizens applied to Henry VIII., through the interest of the Duke
of Norfolk, for a grant of the convent for the use of the city,
and requested that he would allow them to make the church into
&ldquo;a large hall, for the mayor and his brethren, with all the
citizens to repair unto at common assemblies,&rdquo; to make a
chapel of the choir, and to appropriate the rest of the building
to other purposes.&nbsp; This was complied with, and the petition
is dated June 25th, 1540.&nbsp; After this, the guilds of the
several companies in the city, twenty in number, used to hear
mass in the choir, and make their offerings in that place; and
most of them held their feasts in the hall.</p>
<p>In 1544, Henry Fuller, Esq., being then mayor, kept the first
mayor&rsquo;s feast in grand style in the new hall.&nbsp; In
1561, the Earls of Northumberland and Huntingdon, the Lord Thomas
Howard, and Lord Willoughby, with many other lords and knights,
came to Norwich to visit the Duke of Norfolk, and they lodged at
the Duke&rsquo;s palace.&nbsp; At that very time the
mayor&rsquo;s feast was held; and William Mingay, then mayor,
invited the noble lords and their ladies to the banquet.&nbsp;
They accepted the invitation, and were entertained in princely
style; and they expressed great <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>satisfaction with their
reception.&nbsp; After dinner, Mr. John Martin, a wealthy
citizen, delivered the following characteristic
speech:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Maister Mayor of Norwich, and it please
your Worship, you have feasted us like a King.&nbsp; God bless
the Queen&rsquo;s Grace.&nbsp; We have fed plentifully; and now,
whilom I can speak plain English, I heartily thank you Maister
Mayor; and so do we all.&nbsp; Answer, Boys, Answer.&nbsp; Your
Beer is pleasant &amp; potent, and will soon catch us by the
<i>caput</i>, and stop our manners: And so Huzza for the
Queen&rsquo;s Majesty&rsquo;s Grace, and all her
bonny-brow&rsquo;d Dames of Honour.&nbsp; Huzza for Maister Mayor
and our good Dame Mayoress.&nbsp; His noble grace, there he is,
<a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a> God bless him, and all this jolly
company.&nbsp; To all our friends round county, who have a penny
in their purse, and an English heart in their bodies, to keep out
Spanish Dons, and Papists with their faggots to burn our
whiskers.&nbsp; Shove it about, twirl your cap cases, handle your
jugs, and Huzza for Maister Mayor, and his brethren, their
Worships.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On many subsequent occasions, the hall was the scene of grand
civic festivities, to which we shall have to allude
hereafter.</p>
<p>The Triennial Musical Festivals are held here.&nbsp; And,
formerly, the assizes for the city; the nomination of candidates
to represent the city in Parliament; and the mayor&rsquo;s
feasts, which were generally given on the day when he was sworn
into office, were also all held in this spacious building; and on
some festive occasions, nearly 1000 ladies and gentlemen have
dined here, including most of the principal families of the <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>city.&nbsp;
Several times between 1650 and 1700 the hall was proclaimed
&ldquo;a public exchange for the despatch of business between
merchants and tradesmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last time was in 1725,
when it was used only one year.&nbsp; It was opened in October,
1796, as a corn exchange and continued to be used as such every
Saturday till 1828.&nbsp; Under the superintendance of Mr. Barry,
the City Surveyor, a complete restoration of the hall was
effected in 1863.</p>
<p>The exterior of the hall, as seen from the plain, presents an
imposing appearance, chiefly owing to the fine effect of its long
range of clerestory windows, of which there are fourteen on each
side.&nbsp; The five westernmost windows on the south side are
each of three lights, of decorated character, being of earlier
date than any of the other windows.&nbsp; The sixth or
easternmost window is of four lights, perpendicular in
style.&nbsp; On the north side are six beautiful perpendicular
windows of four lights, probably the most elegant in style in the
eastern counties.&nbsp; The principal entrance is through the new
porch on the south-west, which is similar in style to the
original building.&nbsp; A large entrance door is provided in the
centre of the west front, and above this there is a large and
beautiful five-light window, producing a fine effect in the
interior of the hall.&nbsp; The interior consists of a nave, 124
feet by 32 feet; and north and south aisles, 124 feet by 16 feet,
each being divided from the nave by six lofty and
handsomely-moulded stone columns, supporting seven elegant stone
arches.&nbsp; Above these arches are the clerestory windows,
fourteen on each <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>side, perpendicular in style, and somewhat later in
character than the other windows.&nbsp; The roof, which is of
chestnut, is of hammer-beam construction, with moulded spandrel
brackets and circular shafts.&nbsp; From the hammer-beams spring
moulded arch ribs.&nbsp; The rafters, which were originally
visible, are plastered on the underside, giving the effect of
panelling; the ground-work being intense blue with gilded
stars.&nbsp; The hollows in the whole of the timber are coloured
vermillion, and gilded pater&aelig; are inserted within these
hollows at stated distances.&nbsp; The circular ribs are finished
with a bead on the underside, which is decorated by spiral bands,
alternately drab and oak colours.&nbsp; The intersection of the
main timbers at the apex of the roof is distinguished by carved
bosses, richly gilt.&nbsp; The aisle roofs are similarly
decorated, but without the gilded pater&aelig;.&nbsp; At the east
end the orchestra is placed within a recess, under a fine
deeply-moulded stone arch, of large size.</p>
<p>The nave and aisles are lighted at night by nine polished
brass coron&aelig;, of characteristic design, pendant from the
centres of the arched ribs of the roof.&nbsp; When lighted up at
night, during the Choral Society and Festival Concerts, the
interior presents a very brilliant appearance.&nbsp; Amongst the
principal attractions of the hall are the portraits of city
worthies and some historical paintings.&nbsp; A fine work of art,
Queen Eleonora sucking the poison from her husband&rsquo;s wound;
and another, the Death of Lady Jane Grey, by Martin, a native of
this city; may be seen at the west end.&nbsp; Large sums have
been offered for <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>them.&nbsp; The two oldest portraits in the hall are
Queen Anne and Prince George of Denmark.&nbsp; A fine portrait of
Admiral Lord Nelson, painted by Sir William Beechey, was the last
for which the illustrious &ldquo;Norfolk Hero&rdquo; sat after
his return to England in 1801.&nbsp; It is allowed to be an
admirable likeness.&nbsp; He is standing on the quarter deck of a
man of war; the tri-coloured flag of France is lying at his feet;
and the flag of Spain lies on a cannon; leaning against which is
the sword of the Spanish Admiral, Don Xavier Winthysen,
surrendered to him on February 14th, 1797.&nbsp; On the
hero&rsquo;s hat is the magnificent diamond Aigrette, or Plume of
Triumph, and under it the rich pelisse of sable fur, both of
which were presented to him by the Grand Seigneur.&nbsp; He is
decorated with the red riband as Knight of the Bath, and with the
blue riband and medal suspended therefrom, which are the Insignia
of the Order of St. Ferdinand.&nbsp; On his breast are stars of
the most honourable Order of the Bath, of the Grand Cross, of the
Order of St. Ferdinand, and of the Imperial Order of the Crescent
Suspended from his neck by a riband, hang two gold chains, and
another is affixed to his button hole on the right side, all of
which had been presented to him, at various times, for his
unparalleled naval victories.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Such honours England to her hero paid,<br
/>
And peaceful sleeps the mighty Nelson&rsquo;s shade.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This superb painting may be seen at the west end of the hall
on the north side.&nbsp; Gainsborough painted the portrait of Sir
Harbord Harbord, afterwards Lord <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Suffield, considered one of the best
in the hall.&nbsp; Amongst the other portraits in the building
are some painted by Gainsborough, Beechey, Heins, Smith,
Bardwell, Stoppelaer, Adolphe, Opie, Clover, Hoppner, Lawrence,
and Thompson.&nbsp; The following is a list in chronological

<h3><span class="smcap">The Corn Exchange</span>.</h3>
<p>The Corn Exchange is situated in Exchange Street, which
commences at the north end of the Market Place.&nbsp; The
original building, which was erected in <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>1828, at a
cost of &pound;6000, being found too small, was taken down in
1861, and the present spacious edifice was built by a company at
a cost of &pound;16,000, including the site.&nbsp; The exterior
is massive in its effect.&nbsp; The key stone of the large window
has a carved head of Ceres.&nbsp; The interior is well lighted
from the roof, the superficial area of the glass being equal to
the area of the hall.&nbsp; The inside measurement is 125 feet by
81 feet.&nbsp; The height from the floor is 66 feet.&nbsp; At the
east end are portraits of John Culley, Esq., the originator of
the Exchange, and of the late Earl of Leicester, who was justly
regarded as the greatest farmer in Norfolk.&nbsp; A large amount
of business is transacted here every Saturday afternoon.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Norwich Public Library</span>.</h3>
<p>The Norwich Public Library is located in a spacious room built
for the purpose at the end of an avenue opposite the
Guildhall.&nbsp; The first meeting of subscribers was held there
on September 7th, 1837.&nbsp; The library contains about 30,000
volumes, including many old books of divinity and
arch&aelig;ology.&nbsp; The yearly subscription is one guinea
paid by shareholders, and 26s. paid by others; and subscribers
are entitled to borrow two sets of books at a time.&nbsp; The
library is open from 10 a.m. till 9 p.m.&nbsp; Besides the large
room which contains the books, there are smaller rooms for the
convenience of readers.&nbsp; Mr. Langton is the librarian.</p>
<h3><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span><span
class="smcap">The Norfolk and Norwich Museum</span></h3>
<p>is a fine building, erected in 1839, in Broad Street, St.
Andrew&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It contains very valuable collections in
geology, ethnology, and entomology, but chiefly in
ornithology.&nbsp; The specimens in ornithology comprise nearly
all the varieties of the raptores or birds of prey, mostly
supplied by J. H. Gurney, Esq.&nbsp; A large new room in the
adjoining building is filled with specimens of British birds,
also contributed by J. H. Gurney, Esq., whose portrait adorns the
room.&nbsp; The fossil remains of mammalia, for the most part
discovered in Norfolk, are extremely interesting.&nbsp; Two other
spacious rooms have just been added to the Museum, one of which
is filled with Elephantine Remains, contributed by the Rev. Jno.
Gunn; and the botanical department has been enriched by the late
J. D. Salmon&rsquo;s well-arranged specimens, bequeathed by him
to this institution, which is open free on Mondays and
Saturdays.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Norfolk and Norwich Literary
Institution</span></h3>
<p>occupies the upper part of the same building as the Museum,
and a large room in the adjoining one.&nbsp; It was established
in 1822, and contains more than 20,000 well-selected volumes in
the various departments of literature.&nbsp; It is supported by
several hundred subscribers who pay two guineas yearly, and the
shareholders pay a guinea and a half yearly.&nbsp; Every <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>member has
the privilege of borrowing two books, and a pamphlet and review
at the same time.&nbsp; A greater number is allowed to country
members, as well as a longer time for reading.&nbsp; The rooms
are open from 10 a.m. till 9 p.m.&nbsp; Mr. F. Quinton is the
librarian.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Free Library</span>.</h3>
<p>This is a large building at the corner of St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Broad Street; erected in 1856, and opened in 1857, under the Free
Libraries and Museum Act, by the Corporation, at a cost of
&pound;10,000.&nbsp; It includes large rooms for the Museum and
the Free Library, the Literary Institution, and the School of
Art.&nbsp; The Free Library, in the lower room, contains about
4,000 volumes, and the Old Collection called the City
Library.&nbsp; The middle room above is fitted up as a lecture
hall.&nbsp; The School of Art is located at the top of the
building, where rooms are furnished for about 200 pupils, who
receive instruction in drawing, designing, and decorative
art.&nbsp; There is a committee of management for the Free
Library, another for the Museum, and another for the School of
Art.&nbsp; Mr. Harper is the librarian.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Theatre Royal</span></h3>
<p>is situate at a short distance from the Market Place, in
Theatre Street.&nbsp; It is a very plain building, erected in
1826, but the interior is quite commodious enough for the limited
number of patrons which Norwich furnishes to the drama.</p>
<h3><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span><span
class="smcap">The Post Office</span></h3>
<p>is a large, but by no means handsome building; situate in Post
Office Street, near the Market Place.&nbsp; There are two
deliveries from London daily, and mails daily to all parts of the
kingdom.</p>
<h3>THE PARISHES AND PARISH CHURCHES.</h3>
<p>Norwich appears to have taken the lead in the erection of
religious edifices.&nbsp; At a very early period, before the
reign of Edward the Confessor, the city contained 25 churches,
and in the eleventh century, 55 existed in or near the
town.&nbsp; After the conquest, 43 chapels were in the patronage
of the burgesses, most of which were afterwards made
parochial.&nbsp; In the reign of Edward III., 58 parish churches
and chapels were within the walls, besides 19 monastic
institutions and cells, anchorages, &amp;c.&nbsp; Norwich still
contains a greater number of churches and parishes than any other
city in England except London.&nbsp; Many of the present churches
are excellent specimens of ancient architecture.&nbsp; Several of
them are built of squared flints.&nbsp; Besides the cathedral
there are three undoubted specimens of the Norman style, and
there are also many examples of the decorated or florid which
succeeded the lancet style, of the transition style, and of the
perpendicular.&nbsp; This later perpendicular style, which
prevailed during the 15th and 16th centuries, is the chief
characteristic of the city churches.&nbsp; The best examples of
this style are the <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>churches of St. Peter Mancroft, St. Andrew, St. Stephen,
St. Giles, and St. John Maddermarket; also St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall.&nbsp; Of all these churches complete restorations have been
lately effected.&nbsp; The original designs have been faithfully
adhered to by the architects and contractors, which is the
highest praise that can be awarded them.&nbsp; In this age we can
only restore or rebuild; we cannot invent new orders of
architecture.&nbsp; All our restorations take us back to the
middle ages, and the spirit of those ages seems to be again
revived in our parish churches.</p>
<p>We shall now proceed to describe the parishes and parish
churches, in four districts, west, east, north, and south.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Western District</span>.</h4>
<p>The western district is the most prominent, comprising the
Market Place, the parishes of St. Peter at Mancroft, St. Giles,
St. Gregory, St. John&rsquo;s Maddermarket, St. Andrew, St.
Margaret, St. Benedict, St. Swithin, and St. Lawrence.&nbsp;
Nearly all the public buildings are situated in this part of the
town&mdash;the Guildhall, the Corn Hall, the Post Office, the
Museum, the Free Library and School of Art, the Public Library,
and the Literary Institution.&nbsp; The Market Place is about 200
yards in length, and 110 in breadth, but part of that area is
occupied by the Guildhall, and St. Peter&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; A
handsome bronze statue of the Duke of Wellington, 8 ft 6 in.
high, was erected, at a cost of &pound;1000, in the middle of <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the Market
Place in 1854.&nbsp; This statue is placed on a granite pedestal,
surrounded by a low railing with lamps at the corners.&nbsp; The
new Fish Market is on the western side of the Market Place.&nbsp;
It consists of two rows of shops with an open space between, and
was built, a few years ago, at a cost of &pound;6000.&nbsp; On
Saturdays the Market Place presents a highly animated scene, and
is well supplied with provisions of every kind.&nbsp; It is
generally crowded from morning till night by the citizens, and by
the vendors of the produce of the field, the garden, or the
dairy.&nbsp; It is surrounded by handsome shops, warehouses,
hotels, and taverns.</p>
<h5><i>St. Peter of Mancroft</i>.</h5>
<p>This parish was, at the beginning of the Confessor&rsquo;s
reign, an open field, that part of it which is now the Market
Place, being the great croft of the Castle or Magna Crofta.&nbsp;
Towards the end of the Confessor&rsquo;s reign it began to be
built over and inhabited; and at the survey of 1086, the whole
field was owned and held by Ralf de Guader, Earl of Norfolk, in
right of his castle, who granted it to the King in Common to make
a new burgh between them, which burgh contained the entire
parishes of St. Peter of Mancroft and St. Giles.&nbsp; The Earl
Ralf founded the church of St. Peter and St. Paul at Mancroft,
and gave it to his chaplains.&nbsp; On his forfeiture, Robert
Blund, the Sheriff, received an ounce of gold, yearly, from the
chaplains; and on Godric&rsquo;s becoming sheriff, the Conqueror
<a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>gave it to
Wala his chaplain, at which time it was worth &pound;3 per
annum.</p>
<p>Sir Peter Read, though not certainly known to be a native of
this city, yet deserves to be mentioned here, because he was
buried in St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, having this inscription on
his monument:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hereunder lieth the corps of Peter Read,
Esq., who hath worthily served not only his prince and country,
but also the Emperor Charles the Fifth, both at his Conquest of
Barbary, and his siege of Tunis, as also in other places, who had
given him, by the said Emperor, the Order of Barbary, who died on
the 29th December, in the year of our Lord God 1566.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it be demanded why the title of &ldquo;knight&rdquo; was
not put on his tomb, but only &ldquo;esquire,&rdquo; it may be
answered that he was knighted by the Emperor Charles V., and
Queen Elizabeth would suffer no foreign honour to be worn by her
subjects in her dominions, saying, &ldquo;Her sheep should be
known by her mark only.&rdquo;&nbsp; The knight lies buried in
the east corner of the north aisle of this church.&nbsp; His
effigy in complete armour is on a brass plate on the stone.&nbsp;
He gave &pound;4 4<i>s.</i> yearly from the rental of houses in
St. Giles&rsquo;, that the great bell of St. Peter&rsquo;s
Mancroft Church should ring at four o&rsquo;clock every morning
and eight in the evening for the benefit of travellers.</p>
<p>The following epitaph in this church is a specimen of good
versification for the time in which it was written,
1616:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here Richard Anguishe sleepes for whom
alyve<br />
Norwich and Cambridge lately seemed to strive;<br />
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>Both
called him son as seemed well they might;<br />
Both challenged in his life an equal right:<br />
Norwich gave birth and taught him well to speake<br />
The mother English, Latin phrase, and Greeke;<br />
Cambridge with arts adorned his ripening age<br />
Degress and judgment in the sacred page;<br />
Yet Norwich gains the vantage of the strife,<br />
Whiles there he ended where began his life.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September XXIII.&nbsp; Ao Dni.
1616.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The church is a large handsome cruciform structure of
freestone mixed with flint, begun in 1430 and finished in
1455.&nbsp; It is a good example of the perpendicular style, and
is the finest parish church in the city.&nbsp; It is 212 feet in
length, and 70 feet in breadth, with a noble tower 98 feet high,
covered with paneling, and containing an excellent peal of 12
bells, a clock, and chimes.&nbsp; The bells weigh 183 cwt. 2 qrs.
14 lbs., and were exchanged for an old peal of ten in 1775, at a
cost of &pound;800 raised by public subscription.</p>
<p>The clustered pillars supporting the roof, with the arches
surmounting them, are lofty and slender, and the windows are
large and numerous, so that the whole interior has a light and
airy appearance.&nbsp; The roof of the nave is of fine open
timber work, with a sort of wooden vault over each window, like a
stone roof.&nbsp; The Clerestory has seventeen fine windows on
each side, with short transoms in the heads, and good
tracery.&nbsp; The vaulting shafts are brought down to the bottom
of the clerestory windows, and have niches under them.&nbsp;
There is a chancel or small transept on each side of the
nave.&nbsp; The font stands under a perpendicular canopy,
supported by pillars, and forming <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>a baptistry on a raised platform,
with room to walk round the font.&nbsp; The east window is filled
with beautiful stained glass, mostly ancient.&nbsp; There are
some fine paintings in the vestry.&nbsp; The church was restored,
the old pews were replaced by open oak benches, and a new pulpit,
reading desk, and altar rail, handsomely carved, were purchased
in 1851.&nbsp; During the alterations, a vault four or five feet
deep was discovered under the stalls of the choir.&nbsp; The
outer wall of this vault supported the screen dividing the choir
from the nave and aisles, and contained a range of about a dozen
earthen jars, placed on their sides with their mouths open to the
vault.&nbsp; The use of these jars has never been
ascertained.&nbsp; The benefice is a perpetual curacy certified
at &pound;10, and now valued at &pound;87.&nbsp; It was augmented
in 1746 with &pound;200 given by the Rev. J. Francis, with
&pound;100 of royal bounty from 1742 to 1810, and with &pound;400
subscribed by the minister and parishioners in 1818.&nbsp; The
Rev. C. Turner, M.A., is incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. Giles</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Giles&rsquo; Street, west of the Market Place, is one of
the best built in the city, and leads to the small parish of St.
Giles.&nbsp; The church, near the top of the street, was founded
in the reign of William I. by Elwyn the priest, who gave it to
the monks of Norwich.&nbsp; Consequently it is now in the
patronage of the Dean and Chapter.&nbsp; It is frequently called
&ldquo;St. Giles on the Hill&rdquo; in ancient records.&nbsp; It
is a fine structure in the <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>perpendicular style, and is one of
the handsomest old churches in the city.&nbsp; It was wholly
rebuilt in the reign of Richard I., but after 1581 the old
chancel was demolished.&nbsp; A new chancel has been recently
built, and the church completely restored.&nbsp; The nave is of
five bays, and has a good open timber roof, supported by angels
bearing shields, emblazoned with the arms of England, France, and
Castile.&nbsp; The clerestory windows have been modernised.&nbsp;
The south porch has a fine groined vault with fan tracery, and is
surmounted by a parvise, and a rich parapet and cornice.&nbsp;
The nave and aisles are 81 feet long, divided by slender pillars,
and are lighted by large and elegant windows.&nbsp; The tower is
120 feet high, and contains a clock and eight bells.&nbsp; The
church estate consists of small tenements given by Thomas Parker
in 1534.&nbsp; The perpetual curacy, valued at &pound;70, was
augmented from 1744 to 1791 with &pound;1000 of Queen
Anne&rsquo;s bounty.&nbsp; The Rev. W. Nottidge Ripley, M.A., is
the incumbent.</p>
<p>Passing from the Market Place to Pottergate Street we come to
the parish of</p>
<h5><i>St. Gregory</i>.</h5>
<p>The church is a fine structure of great antiquity, in the
perpendicular style.&nbsp; The chancel was rebuilt in 1325, and
the whole pile has received many modern repairs.&nbsp; The nave
and aisles, with the two chapels at the east end, were new leaded
in 1537.&nbsp; In 1597, a timber spire covered with lead was
erected on the <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>tower, and was the only spire in Norwich, except that of
the Cathedral, but being unsafe, it was taken down.&nbsp; The
tower contains a clock and six bells, the latter given by the
parishioners in 1818.&nbsp; The tower arch is very lofty, and
across it is the original stone gallery for the singers, with
groined vaults above and beneath, the lower part forming a
western porch opening into the north and south porches, which are
also groined.&nbsp; There are four well moulded arches on each
side of the nave, with clustered shafts having embattled
caps.&nbsp; The rood stair turret remains on the north side of
the edifice.&nbsp; The clerestory windows have decorated tracery,
and the windows of the aisles are of a mixed character under
arches recessed in the walls.&nbsp; In 1861, Mr. Wm. Smith, and
the incumbent collected &pound;800 for the purpose of restoring
the church and reseating it in oak.&nbsp; The perpetual curacy
was certified at &pound;3, and is now valued at &pound;120.&nbsp;
It was augmented from 1747 to 1812 with &pound;1400 of royal
bounty.&nbsp; The Dean and Chapter are patrons.&nbsp; The present
incumbent is the Rev. J. Wortley.</p>
<h5><i>St. John&rsquo;s Maddermarket</i>.</h5>
<p>is a very populous parish near the Market Place, between
Pottergate Street and Charing Cross.&nbsp; The church is a large
handsome edifice in the perpendicular style, consisting of a
nave, two aisles, two porches, and a fine tower, under which is
an arched rood, and on the top are four figures at the
angles.&nbsp; The fine decorated east window is of five lights
with flowing <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>tracery.&nbsp; The north porch has a richly-groined
vault, and its outer doorway is deeply recessed.&nbsp; The roofs
of the chapel of All Saints at the east end of the north aisle,
and of St. Mary the Virgin in the south aisle, are boarded under
and painted with angels holding books and scrolls, with sentences
from the Te Deum, the Angelical Salutation, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
church has been completely restored recently at a cost of
&pound;1200.&nbsp; Lady Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, (second
wife of the Duke, who was beheaded in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign,)
died at the Duke&rsquo;s Palace, in this parish, in 1563, and was
interred with great pomp on the north side of the choir, where a
mural monument was erected to her memory in 1791 by Lord John
Howard of Waldon.&nbsp; The benefice is a discharged rectory,
valued in K. B. at &pound;7 10s. 2d., and now at
&pound;110.&nbsp; It was augmented from 1714 to 1814 with
&pound;1800 of royal bounty.&nbsp; It is in the patronage of New
College, Oxford, to which it was granted by Henry VI.&nbsp; The
Rev. G. F. Price is the present incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. Andrew</i>.</h5>
<p>The parish of St. Andrew is extensive, and populous, and
improvements have been made in some of the streets, where large
premises have been built.&nbsp; The church in Broad Street, to
which it gives its name, is a fine large perpendicular structure,
consisting of nave, chancel, aisles, clerestory, and tower.&nbsp;
The latter, which has seven bells and a clock, was rebuilt in
1478, and the nave and chancel were rebuilt in 1606.&nbsp; The <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>window at the
east end is filled with stained glass.&nbsp; There are sedilia
for three priests in the chancel, and several old stalls with
&ldquo;misereres.&rdquo;&nbsp; The interior contains many ancient
as well as modern monuments and inscriptions.&nbsp; The whole of
the interior has been recently restored and renovated, and
furnished with open benches instead of the old pews.&nbsp; The
gallery, which obscured the noble tower arch, was removed in
1863, and the fine screen work, so long hidden, brought to
light.&nbsp; There is no chancel arch, but the rood stair turret
still remains on the south side; and under the east window,
externally, are some good niches and panels.&nbsp; A beautiful
carved stone reredos was erected in 1850 by subscription in
memory of the late Rev. James Brown, B.D., who was the esteemed
incumbent of this parish from 1807 to 1856.&nbsp; The benefice is
a perpetual curacy valued in 1831 at &pound;90, and augmented
from 1756 to 1786 with &pound;800 of Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty,
and with a grant of &pound;600 in 1815.&nbsp; The church estate
is let in long leases, for &pound;22 16s. yearly.&nbsp; The
parishioners are the patrons.&nbsp; The Rev. A. C. Copeman, M.A.,
incumbent.&nbsp; In this parish, on St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hill,
stood one of the oldest churches in this city, dedicated to St.
Christopher.&nbsp; It was destroyed by fire in the reign of Henry
VIII.&nbsp; Remains of old vaults may be traced in a line of
vaults and crypts under the City Arms Tavern, and on the premises
of Mr. Harman, Wine and Spirit Merchant, higher up the street on
the east side.</p>
<p>The Old Bridewell, in this parish, was built by Bartholomew
Appleyard about the year 1370.&nbsp; The <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>north wall is
79 feet in length and 27 feet in height, and is considered one of
the greatest curiosities of the kind in England.&nbsp; The flints
are squared to such a nicety, that the edge of a knife can
scarcely be put between them.&nbsp; Most of them are about three
inches square.&nbsp; The surface is very smooth, and no brickwork
can appear more regular.&nbsp; The building was nearly destroyed
by fire on October 22nd, 1751, and again much damaged by fire on
July 28th, 1753, but this curious wall sustained little
injury.&nbsp; Mr. Talman says, &ldquo;That the Jews introduced
the art of squaring flints;&rdquo; and Dr. Cromwell Mortimer,
Secretary to the Royal Society, states that the gate of the
Austin Friars at Canterbury, that of St. John&rsquo;s Abbey at
Colchester, and the gate near the Whitehall, Westminster, are in
the same taste, but the platform on the top of the Royal
Observatory at Paris, built in 1667, which is paved with flint in
this manner, is an instance in proof that the French had
recovered this art exemplified in the Old Bridewell here.&nbsp;
William Appleyard, son of the builder, the first mayor of
Norwich, occupied this house in 1403.&nbsp; After passing through
many hands, it became the property of the late Mr. Newbegin, who
converted it into a tobacco factory.&nbsp; His son, Mr. J.
Newbegin, now holds the property, and has lately built a handsome
wholesale tobacco warehouse on the premises next to the
alley.</p>
<p>In Broad Street, St. Andrews, stood the ancient church of St.
Crucis.&nbsp; It was dedicated to the honour of the Holy Cross,
and was erected before the year 1272.&nbsp; It was desecrated in
1551, and the parish united to St. John&rsquo;s Maddermarket.</p>
<h5><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>St.
Lawrence.</h5>
<p>St. Lawrence Church stands upon the very spot to which the arm
of the sea rose in former times, when Norwich was merely a
fishing town, and this spot was the quay or landing place for all
herrings brought into the city.&nbsp; After the water had
receded, the church was founded on the same site in the reign of
Edward the Confessor, in the 10th century.&nbsp; In 1460, the
original building was taken down, and the present one was erected
twelve years afterwards.&nbsp; It consists of a nave, chancel,
aisles, north and south porches, clerestory, and a tower 112 feet
high, with six bells.&nbsp; The roof of the church is supported
by clustered columns, the inside is light and regular, and the
windows are large and well filled with tracery.&nbsp; They were
formerly decorated with stained glass, all of which was
demolished by the Puritans in 1643.&nbsp; There is here an
ancient octangular font, ornamented with shields, angels,
&amp;c.&nbsp; In the spandrels of an arched door, in the western
side of the church, are two ancient carvings, one representing
the martyrdom of St. Lawrence broiling on a gridiron, and the
other a number of Danish soldiers shooting arrows into the body
of King Edmund, whose head is seen lying in a thicket, as
described in the old legend.&nbsp; The Rev. E. A. Hillyard is the
present incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. Swithin</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Swithin&rsquo;s Church, situated between upper and lower
Westwick Street, is a neat building, containing a nave, two
aisles, and tower.&nbsp; One side of the nave <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>is supported
by pointed arches on columns, and the other by round arches and
square piers.&nbsp; The Chapel of St. Mary, at the east end of
the north aisle, had an altar, and the guild of the Holy Virgin,
called the tanner&rsquo;s guild, was kept there.&nbsp; The
rectory was anciently in the donation of the See of Norwich, and
in the year 1200 was annexed to the deanery of Norwich, as were
the churches of St. Simon and Jude, and Corstweyt, and the
deanery of Taverham, and so held till 1329, when the deaneries
were separated from the churches which were then perpetually
united.&nbsp; But notwithstanding this union, in 1546 Bishop
Rugge separated the advowson from the bishopric, and granted it
to William Farrar and others.&nbsp; In 1608, John Ward was
patron, who suffering a lapse, was by the bishop collated to it;
and entry being made that the bishop had collated him in full
right, it has ever since been supposed to be in the
bishop&rsquo;s patronage, and held by sequestration or license at
the bishop&rsquo;s nomination.&nbsp; During the cleaning of this
Church in 1834, an ancient portrait of Edward the Confessor,
painted on a panel, was found beneath one of the seats, where it
is supposed to have been placed during the civil wars.&nbsp; The
altar piece contains portraits of Moses and Aaron, and the church
has an ancient font.&nbsp; The rectory, valued in K. B. at
&pound;6 3s. 4d., has been augmented, and is still in the
patronage of the bishop.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The New Mills, as to a principal part of them, are in this
parish.&nbsp; Formerly all the city bakers were obliged to grind
here, and the miller, as a public servant, <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>had a livery
and badge given him every year.&nbsp; The mills are still the
property of the city, and in 1706 were let, with the
baker&rsquo;s grant thereto belonging, for the term of 87 years,
at the yearly rent of &pound;200, but reduced in 1708 to
&pound;180.&nbsp; The Mills are now let to Mr. Wells, and produce
a large quantity of flour weekly.&nbsp; Steam mills are now also
at work in this locality, in the occupation of Messrs. Barber and
Sons, who are also proprietors of Hellesdon Mills.</p>
<h5><i>St. Margaret</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Margaret&rsquo;s Church, in Westwick Street, has a square
tower with a spacious nave, chancel, and south aisle.&nbsp; It is
a plain building of the perpendicular period.&nbsp; The rood
stair turret remains on the north side of the church, and on the
south side of the altar is a small pedestal on which the bell
that was rung at mass stood in former times.&nbsp; The rectory is
valued at &pound;80.&nbsp; The bishop is the patron, and the Rev.
J. W. Cobb is the rector.&nbsp; The church which has been for
some time disused, being in a very ruinous condition, has just
been restored.</p>
<h5><i>St. Benedict</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Benedict&rsquo;s Church, at the end of the street to which
it gives its name, is a small building with nave, chancel, north
aisle, and round tower.&nbsp; The tower contains three bells, and
in the chancel is a piscina.&nbsp; The church was repaired and
re-roofed a few years <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>since, at a cost of &pound;150.&nbsp;
The living is a perpetual curacy valued at &pound;95, and was
augmented by royal bounty.&nbsp; The Rev. J. Dombrain is the
incumbent.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Eastern District</span>.</h4>
<p>This side of the city has been greatly improved by the
formation of a new road called Prince of Wales&rsquo; Road, from
Foundry Bridge to the Castle Hill.&nbsp; Handsome houses have
been built on each side, and broad pavements laid down.&nbsp;
Rose Lane has been widened and improved.&nbsp; The Castle Meadow
has been adorned by the erection of a new bank called the Crown
Bank, a very handsome building in the Corinthian style of
architecture.&nbsp; This is the finest building of the kind in
the eastern counties.</p>
<p>The Cavalry Barracks are situated in Barrack Street on the
east side of the city, on the site of an old manor house.&nbsp;
They were built by the government in 1791 at a cost of
&pound;20,000.&nbsp; The buildings are of brick, and form three
sides of a square, the centre being for the accommodation of the
officers.&nbsp; The wings accommodate the soldiers to the extent
of 320 men, and 266 horses.&nbsp; The high wall which surrounds
the entire barracks, including the parade ground, encloses an
area of ten acres.</p>
<p>The Dungeon Tower is opposite the barracks, on land called
&ldquo;The Hospital Meadow.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a large round
tower of brick, originally surrounded by a battlement.&nbsp; It
was built as a prison for the cathedral <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>precincts.&nbsp; The Norfolk Railway Station stands in
the hamlet of Thorpe near the Foundry Bridge.</p>
<h5><i>St. Michael at Plea</i>.</h5>
<p>The Church of St. Michael at Plea is at the top of Queen
Street.&nbsp; This church was so named from the Archdeacon
holding his pleas or courts there.&nbsp; It is a cruciform church
with a low flint tower, and a modern bell turret.&nbsp; Its
transepts were formerly chapels dedicated to St. John the Baptist
and the Virgin Mary.&nbsp; It contains several old paintings of
the crucifixion, resurrection, &amp;c., in the panels.&nbsp;
About two years ago the tower was restored at a cost of
&pound;250.&nbsp; The rectory, valued in K. B. at &pound;6 10s.,
and in 1831 at &pound;85, was augmented with &pound;600 of Queen
Anne&rsquo;s bounty from 1774 to 1791, and with a parliamentary
grant of &pound;1000 in 1816.&nbsp; The lords of the manors of
Sprowston and Horsford are patrons alternately.&nbsp; The Rev. C.
Morse, LL.B., is the incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. George Tombland</i>.</h5>
<p>The Church of St. George Tombland stands at the end of
Prince&rsquo;s Street, and is so named from the open space near
it having formerly been used as a burying place.&nbsp; It has a
handsome square tower which contains five bells, and was erected
by the parishioners in 1445.&nbsp; The nave, aisles, and chancel
are covered with lead, and have some spacious galleries and
ornamental <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>inscriptions of ancient and modern times.&nbsp; The
building is chiefly of the perpendicular period, but some
portions are of an older date.&nbsp; Three new memorial windows
were recently inserted on the north side.&nbsp; Messrs. J. and J.
King, Prince&rsquo;s Street, put in the stained glass.&nbsp; The
Rev. W. Bridge was ejected from the incumbency of this parish for
refusing to read the Book of Sports.&nbsp; He afterwards became
pastor of the Old Meeting House.&nbsp; The churchyard has been
planted with shrubs, and if a neat iron railing were substituted
for the present wall, it would greatly improve the appearance of
Tombland.&nbsp; The Rev. K. Trimmer is the incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. Peter Hungate</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Peter Hungate Church is in the same street at the top of
Elm Hill.&nbsp; The original church was demolished in 1458, when
the present one was built.&nbsp; It was built by John Paston and
Margaret his wife.&nbsp; It is of black flint in the form of a
cross, having a nave, chancel, transepts, and square tower with
two bells.&nbsp; The roof of the nave is ornamented with figures
of angels.&nbsp; In 1861 the interior was much improved.&nbsp;
The rectory of St. Peter Hungate, valued in K.B. at &pound;3 1s.
5&frac12;d., and now at &pound;63, was augmented from 1743 to
1810 with &pound;600 of royal bounty.&nbsp; The Lord Chancellor
is patron, and the Rev. S. Titlow, M.A., has been rector since
1839.</p>
<h5><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span><i>St.
Simon and Jude</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Simon and Jude&rsquo;s Church in Wensum Street has a nave,
a chancel, and a low flint and stone tower, with five
bells.&nbsp; It is in the perpendicular style, and is of great
antiquity.&nbsp; It contains a few old brasses, and several
monuments of the Pettus family, in one of which lies, in complete
armour, the figure of Sir J. Pettus, the first of the family who
was knighted.&nbsp; The Rev. J. F. Osborne is the incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. Martin at Palace</i>.</h5>

<h5><i>St. Helen</i>.</h5>
<p>The parish of St. Helen is situated on the east side of the
cathedral, and nearly the whole of the parish belongs to the
Great Hospital, which is an extensive range of buildings,
comprising the antique remains of <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>the dissolved hospital of St. Giles,
and several modern additions erected at various periods, for the
accommodation of the alms people who have been increased in
number progressively with the augmentation of the income.&nbsp;
In 1850, ninety-two men, and eighty-two women were lodged, fed,
and clothed at the expense of the charity, which also supports a
master and ten nurses.&nbsp; The alms people must be of the age
of 65 years or upwards before their admission.&nbsp; They are
clothed in dark blue, and allowed sixpence per week each for
pocket money.</p>
<p>St. Helen&rsquo;s Church in Bishopgate Street belonged to the
monks, who demolished it and consolidated the cure with the
church of St. Giles&rsquo; Hospital, now called the Great
Hospital, on the opposite side of the street, soon after the
foundation of the latter by Bishop Suffield in 1250.&nbsp; The
whole of this hospital church, which serves as the parish church
of St. Helen, is still standing.&nbsp; It has a square
perpendicular tower at the south-west corner, containing one
bell.&nbsp; The greater part of the pile has been converted into
lodgings for the alms people.&nbsp; The church is fitted up with
gothic carved work and open seats.&nbsp; Kirkpatrick, the
antiquary, is buried here.&nbsp; The perpetual curacy received by
lot &pound;200 of Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty in 1816, and was
valued in 1831 at &pound;16 exclusive of the glebe house, but is
now worth &pound;200 per annum.&nbsp; The City Charity Trustees
are patrons.&nbsp; The Rev. W. F. Patteson, incumbent.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>In King
Street are the churches of St. Peter per Mountergate, St. Julian,
St. Etheldred, and St. Peter Southgate, all ancient edifices.</p>
<h5><i>St. Peter per Mountergate</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Peter per Mountergate derives the latter part of its name
from a gate formerly placed near the churchyard, at the foot of
the Castle mount.&nbsp; The old church is in the perpendicular
style, and has a nave, chancel, south porch with parvise, and a
square embattled tower, with five bells and a clock.&nbsp; The
building has been recently restored and fitted up with open
benches, those in the nave being stained deal, and in the chancel
oak.&nbsp; The famous Thomas Codd, who was Mayor of Norwich
during Kett&rsquo;s Rebellion, and who was a great benefactor to
the city, was interred in the nave.&nbsp; The benefice is now a
perpetual curacy, valued at &pound;78, and augmented with
&pound;200 of Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty in 1766, and with a
parliamentary grant of &pound;800 in 1812.&nbsp; The Dean and
Chapter are patrons.&nbsp; The Rev. John Durst, incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. Julian</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Julian&rsquo;s Church, in King Street, is a very small
ancient structure, founded before the conquest, and comprises
nave, chancel, north porch, and tower.&nbsp; It is principally of
the Norman period, and most of the windows are decorated and
perpendicular insertions.&nbsp; The tower, which is ruined, has a
deeply recessed Norman arch, slightly pointed, and having shafts
with <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>caps
and bases.&nbsp; It has also a small Norman loop window in the
thickness of the wall splayed both inside and outside.&nbsp; The
south doorway is a very fine specimen of Norman architecture, and
was restored in 1845, when the chancel was rebuilt and the church
thoroughly restored at a cost of &pound;500.&nbsp; The east
window was at the same time filled with stained glass,
representing our Saviour seated and surrounded by the
evangelists.&nbsp; The font is perpendicular in style, cup-shaped
and panelled.&nbsp; There was a hermitage for a female recluse in
the churchyard, but it was demolished at the dissolution.&nbsp;
The rectory, certified at &pound;19 3s. 1d., has been long
consolidated with All Saints.&nbsp; The Rev. C. F. Sculthorpe,
M.A., is patron.</p>
<h5><i>St. Etheldred</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Etheldred&rsquo;s Church, in King Street, is supposed to
be one of the oldest structures in the city, and had in its
burial ground a very ancient anchorage, which continued till
after the Reformation.&nbsp; It is a small building with a nave,
chancel, and tower.&nbsp; The benefice is a perpetual curacy,
certified at &pound;2 14s., and valued at &pound;77.&nbsp; It was
augmented from 1745 to 1802 with &pound;800 of Queen Anne&rsquo;s
bounty.&nbsp; The Trustees of the Great Hospital are
patrons.&nbsp; The Rev. W. Bishop is the present incumbent.</p>
<p>The parish of St. Etheldred seems to have been one of the
parishes of the Anglo Saxon period, and in it formerly were the
houses of many families of distinction, including the residences
of Sir Thomas de <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>Helgheton, of Henry de Norwich, of the Abbot of
Wymondham, of Sir James Hobart, and of Sir Robert de Sulle, who
was killed by the rebels in the reign of Edward III.&nbsp; No
remains of these houses now exist.&nbsp; All along the east side
of King Street, next the river, there is a line of vaults, which
seem to have formed the foundations of old churches now
demolished.&nbsp; The Old Music House still stands in King
Street, in the parish of St. Etheldred, and on its site formerly
stood the house of one of the rich Jews, who settled here in the
reign of William Rufus.&nbsp; It afterwards became the property
of his grandson Isaac, at whose death it was escheated to the
crown.&nbsp; Henry III. gave it to Sir William de Valeres, Knt.,
and in 1290 it was the residence of Alan de Frestons, Archdeacon
of Norfolk, who had a public chapel there.&nbsp; In 1626, it
belonged to John Paston, Esq., and in 1633 it was the city house
of Chief Justice Coke.&nbsp; The present house is not older than
the 17th century.&nbsp; Under it there are very extensive vaults
of a more ancient date, now occupied by Messrs. Youngs, Crawshay,
and Youngs, as ale stores.</p>
<h5><i>St. Peter Southgate</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Peter Southgate, near the south end of King Street, is an
ancient church, with a nave, chancel, north chapel, south porch,
and a square flint tower, in which are three bells.&nbsp; The
windows are chiefly square headed, and the architecture is of the
late perpendicular period.&nbsp; There is a good cross on the
east <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>gable.&nbsp; Part of an old screen remains in front of
the north chapel.&nbsp; The Rev. W. Bishop is the incumbent.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Carrow Works, at the top of King Street, are the most
extensive in England for the production of flour, starch,
mustard, and blue.&nbsp; The works cover an area of five
acres.&nbsp; They are conveniently situated on the banks of the
Yare, and are permeated by trams from the Great Eastern
Railway.&nbsp; Here are large flour mills, starch mills, and
mustard mills, in which 1200 hands are employed.&nbsp; Steam
engines to the enormous amount of 400 horse power are used to
drive the machinery.&nbsp; About 100 tons of goods are produced
here weekly, and sent away by rail to all parts of England,
Europe, and America.&nbsp; A large number of hands are engaged in
making the tins and wooden boxes in which most of the mustard is
packed.&nbsp; We visited Carrow Works chiefly to see the mustard,
starch, and blue factories; but we were tempted to take a peep at
the great flour mill which has been erected by Messrs. J. and J.
Colman, and which for magnitude and completeness has few
equals.&nbsp; The machinery in this mill is driven by a
magnificent pair of engines of 80 horse power.&nbsp; The Mayor
for the present year, 1868, J. J. Colman, Esq., is the principal
proprietor of these great works, and he has built many houses all
around for his work-people, and also schools for their children
at a cost of &pound;2000.</p>
<p>A Nunnery formerly stood outside of King Street Gates, and was
called Carrow Abbey, from &ldquo;carr&rdquo; a watering place,
and &ldquo;hoe&rdquo; a hill.&nbsp; This abbey was <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>dedicated to
St. Michael and St. John.&nbsp; It was founded in the year 1146
by two ladies named Leftelina and Seyna.&nbsp; It was richly
endowed by King Stephen, and consisted of a prioress and nine
benedictine black nuns, afterwards increased to twelve.&nbsp; The
site within the walls contained about ten acres of land, and the
revenues and possessions were extensive.&nbsp; At the dissolution
the abbey and lands became private property.&nbsp; J. H. Tillett,
Esq., is the present occupier.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Northern District</span>.</h4>
<p>This district includes all the parishes from the north-west to
the north-east side of the river Wensum; and comprises the
parishes of St. Michael at Coslany, St. Martin at Oak, St.
Augustine, St. Mary, St. George&rsquo;s Colegate, St. Clement,
St. Saviour, St. Paul, St. James, and St. Edmund.&nbsp; On the
north side we enter the oldest part of the city, which seems to
have been always chosen by the poorest portion of the population,
near the great factories, which stand high above all the
surrounding poverty-stricken dwellings.</p>
<h5><i>St. Michael at Coslany</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Michael at Coslany, commonly called St. Miles&rsquo;, is a
spacious church, with a lofty square tower and eight musical
bells.&nbsp; The nave was rebuilt by John and Stephen Stallon,
who were sheriffs in 1511 and 1512.&nbsp; The south aisle was
begun by Gregory Clark, and was finished by his son, who was
Mayor in 1514.&nbsp; The <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>interior is handsomely
decorated.&nbsp; At the east end of the south aisle there is a
chapel, founded by Robert Thorp in the reign of Henry VII.,
encrusted externally with black flints, like inlaid work.&nbsp;
The altar piece, by Heins, represents the Resurrection and the
Four Evangelists, and the floor is paved with black and white
marble, brought from the domestic chapel at Oxnead.&nbsp; There
are a few ancient brasses and modern mural monuments.&nbsp; The
rectory, valued in K.B. at &pound;13 6s. 8d. and now at
&pound;117, was augmented in 1738 with &pound;200 bequeathed by
the Rev. E. Brooke; in 1818, with &pound;200 given by the late
rector; and from 1738 to 1818 with &pound;1000 of royal
bounty.&nbsp; Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, had the
patronage of the living, which was usually given to the oldest
bachelor of that college.&nbsp; It has recently been purchased by
the Rev. E. Hollond, Benhall Lodge, Suffolk.&nbsp; The Rev. R. H.
Kidd is the incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. Martin at Oak</i>.</h5>
<p>The parish of St. Martin at Oak, in Coslany Street, and the
whole neighbourhood, is a very old part of the city, full of very
poor people.&nbsp; The church derived its name from a large oak
which formerly stood in the churchyard.&nbsp; This was much
visited during the reign of superstition, and many legacies were
given towards painting, repairing, and dressing the image of St.
Mary in the Oak.&nbsp; Another oak was planted on the same spot
in 1656, but that now growing was planted <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>eight years
ago.&nbsp; The church is built of flint and stone in the
perpendicular style, and contains some good piers.&nbsp; In 1852,
the chancel was rebuilt and a new organ was placed in the church;
and in 1862, plain open benches were substituted for the old pews
in the chancel.&nbsp; There are a few monuments and brasses in
the church, and in one of the former are effigies of Jeremiah
Ravens and his wife in alabaster.&nbsp; She died in 1711, and he
in 1727.&nbsp; The south porch is now used as a vestry, and the
outer doorway is built up.&nbsp; The benefice is a perpetual
curacy, certified at 20s., and now valued at &pound;102.&nbsp; It
was augmented with &pound;200 given by William Nockells in 1722,
and &pound;1000 of royal bounty obtained from 1723 to 1824.&nbsp;
The Dean and Chapter are patrons.&nbsp; Rev. C. Caldwell, B.A.,
the esteemed incumbent, is much respected for his kindness to the
poor.</p>
<h5><i>St. Augustine</i>.</h5>
<p>From St. Martin at Oak we pass onward into St.
Augustine&rsquo;s, where we find various factories and a very
populous neighbourhood.&nbsp; The church, on the east side of the
Gildencroft, is in the perpendicular style, and consists of a
nave with aisles, chancel with aisles, south porch and
tower.&nbsp; The tower contains a clock and three bells.&nbsp;
The roof of the north aisle of the chancel is finely carved, and
the clerestory is built of flint.&nbsp; In the south aisle of the
nave is a marble monument in memory of Thomas Clabburn,
manufacturer, who died in 1858.&nbsp; It was erected by <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>the
subscriptions of more than 600 weavers of Norwich as a tribute to
his many virtues.&nbsp; The rectory, valued in K.B. at &pound;6
7s. 8&frac12;d. and now at &pound;150, was augmented in 1781 with
&pound;200 of Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty, and in 1810, 1811, and
1821, with &pound;1400 in parliamentary grants.&nbsp; The Dean
and Chapter are the patrons.&nbsp; The Rev. Matthew John Rackham
is the incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. Mary Coslany</i>.</h5>
<p>From St. Augustine&rsquo;s we pass down Pitt Street to the
parish of St. Mary, inhabited chiefly by poor people.&nbsp; The
church is a cruciform structure with a tall round tower of flint,
containing six bells.&nbsp; There are no aisles.&nbsp; The south
porch has a good groined vault and a richly moulded doorway, with
a parvise or chamber above.&nbsp; The chancel has a panelled
ceiling with rich perforated work.&nbsp; The pulpit is ancient
and has tracery in the upper part of the panels, with the linen
pattern below, and a perforated iron projection for the book
rest.&nbsp; The font is octagonal, and has painted shields of
arms in its upper panels.&nbsp; The rood-stair turret is at the
intersection of the north transept and chancel.&nbsp; At the west
end of the nave there is an old parish chest, and in the south
transept there is a square-headed foliated piscina.&nbsp; Several
ancient stalls are remaining, and in the north wall of the
chancel there is a tombstone of the Elizabethan era, dated 1578,
and having incised figures of Martin Vankermbeck, M.D., and his
wife.&nbsp; The perpetual curacy was augmented, from 1733 to
1824, with &pound;2200 <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>of royal bounty, and is valued at
&pound;124.&nbsp; The Marquis of Townshend is patron.&nbsp; Rev.
C. Morse, LL.B., is incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. George Colegate</i>.</h5>
<p>We pass on eastward to the parish of St. George&rsquo;s
Colegate, wherein are some of the best built streets on this side
of the city.&nbsp; The church is a large structure rebuilt at
different periods, viz., the tower and nave about 1459; the
chancel in 1498; the north aisle with the chapel of St. Mary in
1504; and the south aisle with the chapel of St. Peter in
1513.&nbsp; The tower is lofty and has a clock and three
bells.&nbsp; The rood-stair turret still remains on the south
side.&nbsp; The east window is of three lights, and is filled
with painted glass by Mr. Swan, with figures representing Faith,
Hope, and Charity.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy, valued
at &pound;98, and augmented from 1737 to 1792 with &pound;1000 of
Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty.&nbsp; The Dean and Chapter are
patrons.&nbsp; The Rev. A. W. Durdin, incumbent.&nbsp; The
memorial to John Crome, familiarly known to Norwich citizens, and
to artists and connoisseurs in paintings as &ldquo;Old
Crome,&rdquo; one of the most esteemed of our Norwich
&ldquo;worthies,&rdquo; has just been placed in the church of St.
George Colegate, in which parish he passed the latter years of
his life, and in which he died soon after being chosen
churchwarden, in the year 1821.&nbsp; The idea of erecting a
monument to the memory of Crome originated in 1841, amongst some
of his fellow-citizens who were <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>lovers of the fine arts, but the
subscriptions received up to 1844 appear only to have amounted to
about twenty-six pounds.&nbsp; At the death of Mr. Lound, who had
been receiving the subscriptions, in 1861, Mr. J. B. Morgan,
determining to carry out the object of the subscribers,
recommended the work of canvassing for subscriptions, which
ultimately reached the sum of about &pound;100.&nbsp; Funds
having been raised, a committee of amateur artists was formed,
who consulted Mr. Bell, an eminent sculptor, of London, and a
native of this city, by whom a handsome mural tablet has been
placed at the east end of the south aisle of St. George&rsquo;s
Church to the memory of Crome.&nbsp; This tablet, which is of
white marble, is divided into three panels, the centre panel
containing a bas-relief profile bust of John Crome.&nbsp; Judging
from the portrait of Crome recently hung in the Council Chamber,
this is an admirable likeness of the Norwich landscape
painter.&nbsp; Beneath are the name &ldquo;John Crome&rdquo; in
gold letters, and a palette and pencils; and above an elegantly
carved laurel wreath.&nbsp; On one panel is the following:
&ldquo;Near this spot lie the remains of one of England&rsquo;s
greatest landscape painters, born in this city, December 21st,
1769, and died in this parish April 22nd, 1821;&rdquo; and on the
right-hand panel, &ldquo;This memorial is erected forty-seven
years after his death by admirers of his art, principally
connected with Norfolk, his native county.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>St.
Clement&rsquo;s parish includes St. Clement Within and St.
Clement Without.&nbsp; The population increased from 853
inhabitants in 1801 to nearly 4000 in 1861.&nbsp; This large
increase occurred chiefly in the northern suburb of the city,
called New Catton, which, in 1842, was constituted an
ecclesiastical district, and assigned to Christ Church, a new
edifice built there.&nbsp; Some centuries ago, several old
churches, called St. Anne&rsquo;s Chapel, All Saints, St.
Botolph, and St. Margaret, existed in this parish, but no
vestiges now remain.</p>
<p>St. Clement&rsquo;s Church, in Colegate Street, is one of the
oldest in the city, and belonged to the manor of
Tokethorpe.&nbsp; It has a square tower with three bells, a nave
without aisles, and a chancel, all in the perpendicular
styles.&nbsp; The chancel contains four dedication crosses, and
is separated from the nave by a fine arch.&nbsp; The tower arch
is blocked by the organ and gallery.&nbsp; The communion plate
weighs 88 ozs., including a silver gilt cup given by S. Sofyld in
1569.&nbsp; Three parish houses are let for &pound;26 10s.
yearly, which is applied with the church rates, except a reserved
yearly rent of 3s. 4d. payable to the Great Hospital, pursuant to
a lease granted in 1569 for 500 years.&nbsp; The rectory valued
in K.B. at &pound;7 9s. 2d., and now at &pound;96, was augmented
in 1738 with &pound;200 of Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty, and
&pound;200 bequeathed by the Rev. Edward Brooke.&nbsp; It is in
the patronage of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and
incumbency of the Rev. R. Rigg.</p>
<h5><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span><i>Christ Church</i>.</h5>
<p>Christ Church in New Catton was consecrated by Bishop Stanley
amid a disturbance caused by the chartists.&nbsp; It is a chapel
of ease in the improving parish of St. Clement.&nbsp; It is a
neat structure of flint and brick in the early English style,
comprising nave, chancel, transepts, and a bell turret at the
west end.&nbsp; It was finished in 1841 at a cost of about
&pound;2500, and has sittings for 600 people.&nbsp; It was built
by subscription, and by the same means &pound;800 have been
invested for its endowment, and &pound;200 for its
reparation.&nbsp; The rector of St. Clement&rsquo;s is patron of
the perpetual curacy, valued at &pound;150, and it is now in the
incumbency of the Rev. Robert Wade, B.A.</p>
<h5><i>St. Saviour</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Saviour&rsquo;s Church, in Magdalen Street, is a small
structure, and has a square tower with two bells.&nbsp; It has
some modern monuments.&nbsp; The south porch is now used as a
baptistry.&nbsp; The font has an octagonal panelled basin, and is
supported by four shafts resting on lions&rsquo; heads, and
carried through ogee canopies with pinnacles between.&nbsp; The
perpetual curacy was certified at &pound;3, and is now valued at
&pound;103.&nbsp; It was augmented from 1729 to 1813 with
&pound;1800 of royal bounty.&nbsp; The Dean and Chapter are
patrons.&nbsp; The Rev. W. Harris Cooke, M.A., incumbent.</p>
<h5><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span><i>St.
Edmund</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Edmund&rsquo;s Church, in Fishgate Street, was founded in
the reign of William I.&nbsp; It comprises a nave, chancel, south
aisle, and tower with one bell.&nbsp; The arches of the nave are
nearly flat, and the sub-arches are carried on shafts with
moulded caps.&nbsp; The rectory, valued in K.B. at &pound;4 6s.
3d., and now at &pound;165, was augmented in 1726 with &pound;200
given by Rev. W. Stanley and Rev. R. Corey, and from 1726 to 1819
with &pound;1000 of royal bounty.&nbsp; The Rev. T. Taylor is the
incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. James</i>.</h5>
<p>St. James&rsquo; Church, in Cowgate, includes Pockthorpe in
its parish, and was a well endowed rectory till 1201, when it was
appropriated to the Cathedral Priory.&nbsp; It is now a peculiar
of the Dean and Chapter.&nbsp; The Rev. A. D. Pringle,
incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. Paul</i>.</h5>
<p>St. Paul&rsquo;s Church, in the square called St. Paul&rsquo;s
Plain, is an old dilapidated building with a small round tower,
the upper part of which was octagonal, but was rebuilt about 1819
of white brick with stone coping.&nbsp; It has some decorated
windows, but is chiefly in the perpendicular style.&nbsp; There
is a north aisle, and at the east end a parclose, the two screens
of different patterns, but both in the same perpendicular
style.&nbsp; The perpetual curacy was certified at only &pound;2,
but was augmented from 1745 to 1749 with &pound;200 of Queen
Anne&rsquo;s bounty, and is now worth &pound;150.&nbsp; <a

<h4><span class="smcap">The Southern District</span>.</h4>
<h5><i>St. Stephen</i>.</h5>
<p>The parish of St. Stephen&rsquo;s, on the south side of the
city, is extensive and populous.&nbsp; The streets present some
good shops and places of business.&nbsp; The principal streets
are Rampant Horse Street, St. Stephen&rsquo;s Street, and Surrey
Street.&nbsp; The Norfolk and Norwich Hospital is at the top of
St. Stephen&rsquo;s Street, and the far-famed Norwich Union Fire
and Life Office is in Surrey Street.</p>
<p>The church, at the west end of Rampant Horse Street, is a
handsome edifice of the late perpendicular style, of the 16th
century, with a nave and clerestory, two aisles, a chancel, two
small chapels, and a square tower.&nbsp; The nave is divided from
the aisles by fluted columns with pointed arches.&nbsp; The
windows are large and numerous, and that at the east end is
filled with stained glass representing the life of the Virgin
Mary, and dated 1610.&nbsp; This church was founded before the
Norman Conquest, but has been all rebuilt at different periods,
the chancel about 1520, and the nave in 1550.&nbsp; The roof is a
fine specimen of open timber-work, and is richly carved.&nbsp;
The tower stands on the north side of the church, and beneath it
is the porch.&nbsp; In 1859, the interior was thoroughly restored
at a cost of &pound;1500, and a new carved pulpit and a reading
desk were put <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>up at the same time.&nbsp; Under the superintendence of
Mr. Phipson, the county architect, ten new windows have been
lately inserted in this church, five on each side.&nbsp; They are
in the perpendicular style corresponding to the style of the
building.&nbsp; They are glazed with cathedral glass and a ruby
border.&nbsp; There is also a new window over the south door of
the chancel.&nbsp; It is glazed with painted glass of a
geometrical pattern, put in by the London firm that produced the
work in the large western window, representing the death of St.
Stephen.&nbsp; That window cost &pound;300.&nbsp; The benefice is
a discharged vicarage, valued in K.B. at &pound;9, and now at
&pound;212.&nbsp; It was augmented from 1715 to 1812 with
&pound;1000 of royal bounty.&nbsp; The Dean and Chapter are
patrons.&nbsp; The Rev. C. Baldwin, vicar.</p>
<h5><i>St. John Sepulchre</i>.</h5>
<p>St. John Sepulchre is a large church at the top of Ber Street,
dedicated to St. John the Baptist and the Holy Sepulchre, and
founded in the reign of Edward the Confessor.&nbsp; It consists
of a nave, chancel, a sort of transept chapel on each side, and a
lofty tower with five bells and a clock.&nbsp; The font is
octagonal and is ornamented with angels, lions, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
east window is of three lights filled with stained glass, the
centre light presenting a figure of St. John the Baptist.&nbsp;
The window is in memory of the Rev. Samuel Stone, M.A., incumbent
of this parish, who was a great friend of the poor, and died in
1848.&nbsp; Here is a fine mural monument of the Watts
family.&nbsp; The rood-stair turret <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>still remains, and in the south side
of the chancel is a fine consecration cross.&nbsp; The living is

&pound;144.&nbsp; It was augmented from 1737 to 1812 with
&pound;1600 of royal bounty.&nbsp; The Dean and Chapter are
patrons.&nbsp; The Rev. W. T. Moore, incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. Michael at Thorn</i>.</h5>
<p>This part of the city includes the parish of St. Michael at
Thorn, so called from the &ldquo;thorns&rdquo; formerly growing
in the neighbourhood, of which there is one now in the
churchyard.&nbsp; The Rev. A. Davies is incumbent of the
parish.&nbsp; The church is remarkable for its antiquity.</p>
<h5><i>All Saints</i>.</h5>
<p>At the bottom of Ber Street we may turn to the left into the
parish of All Saints, where the church stands in an open space
called All Saints&rsquo; Green.&nbsp; The church is a small
structure, having a nave, chancel, porch, and tower containing
three bells.&nbsp; The chancel contains some decorated windows,
but the other portions of the church are perpendicular.&nbsp; The
east window is modern and filled with poor stained glass, but
there are some fragments of ancient stained glass, containing
heads of bishops, &amp;c., in the windows of the aisles.&nbsp;
The font is octagonal and in the perpendicular style.&nbsp; There
are three monuments with merchant&rsquo;s marks upon them.&nbsp;
The rectory, valued in K.B. <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>at &pound;3 14s. 7d., is consolidated
with St. Julian, valued in K.B. at &pound;5.&nbsp; The joint
benefices are now worth &pound;300 per annum.&nbsp; They were
augmented with &pound;300 of Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty in 1769
and 1810, and with &pound;200 given by John Drinkwater, Esq., and
&pound;500 given by S. Thornton, Esq., in 1800.&nbsp; The Rev. C.
F. Sculthorpe, M.A., is patron, and the Rev. G. S. Outram is
incumbent.</p>
<h5><i>St. John Timberhill</i>.</h5>
<p>St. John&rsquo;s Timberhill, at the north end of Ber Street,
was founded soon after the priory of Norwich, to which it was
appropriated, and it was dedicated to St. John the Baptist.&nbsp;
It has a nave, chancel, south porch with parvise, and two aisles
with chapels at their east ends.&nbsp; That on the north, a part
of which is now used for the vestry, was called our Lady&rsquo;s
Chapel.&nbsp; There is a hagroscope or squint on the south side
of the chancel, and near it is a small decorated piscina.&nbsp;
The font is circular and Norman.&nbsp; The whole building needs
restoration.&nbsp; The square tower fell down on August 20th,
1784, and damaged the west end of the church.&nbsp; Its
foundations still remain, but the bells were sold to pay for the
repairs.&nbsp; The perpetual curacy was augmented from 1738 to
1813 with &pound;1000 of royal bounty, and valued in 1835 at
&pound;31.&nbsp; The Dean and Chapter are patrons.&nbsp; The Rev.
S. Titlow, M.A., has been the incumbent since 1831.</p>
<h5><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span><i>Chapel Field</i>.</h5>
<p>There is yet left unnoticed a small district lying south of
St. Giles&rsquo;, and which is generally known as Chapel
Field.&nbsp; Near this field once stood a college called St. Mary
in the Fields, founded about the beginning of the 13th century by
John Le Brun.&nbsp; Soon after its establishment its benefactors
were so numerous that in a short time it became a very noble
college, having a dean, chancellor, precentor, treasurer, seven
prebendaries, and six chaplains.&nbsp; Miles Spencer, the last
dean, persuaded the college to resign its revenues for small
pensions, after he had obtained a grant of the whole for himself
from Henry VIII. at the dissolution.&nbsp; The property
afterwards passed through several hands, and the field is now the
property of the corporation.&nbsp; It has recently been enclosed
by a massive palisade, and much improved as a place of
recreation; and a large Drill Hall has been built at the
north-west corner for the use of the Volunteers.&nbsp; The Drill
Hall was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1866.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Hamlets</span>.</h4>
<h5><i>Heigham</i>.</h5>
<p>The hamlets have, of late years, been greatly increased in
extent and population, and are likely to leave the old city in
the shade.&nbsp; Heigham, on the west side of the city, has
become a town, with two <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>churches, and another about to be
built, three chapels, and several large schools.&nbsp; Since
1801, the population has increased from 544 to 15,000
souls.&nbsp; Many new streets have been laid out between the
Dereham and Earlham Roads; long rows of new houses have been
built, and are nearly all occupied.&nbsp; The National
School-house, on Dereham road, was built in 1840 at a cost of
&pound;1000, and is attended by about 270 children.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <span class="smcap">City Jail</span>, an ugly building,
stands in this hamlet at the corner of St. Giles&rsquo;
Road.&nbsp; It was built in 1827 from a design by Mr. Philip
Barnes, of Norwich, at a cost of &pound;30,000.&nbsp; The front
elevation is massive and is supported by Tuscan columns.&nbsp;
The whole building encloses an area of 1 acre 2 roods 34 poles,
and contains 114 cells.&nbsp; The house of the governor stands in
the centre and commands a view of the entire prison, which is
well ventilated and supplied with water pumped by the
tread-wheel.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <span class="smcap">New Water Works</span> are in this
hamlet, and supply the city with water from the river
Wensum.&nbsp; After filtration the water is forced up by steam
power to the distributing reservoir at Lakenham, at a height of
134 feet above the level of the river at Carrow Bridge, whence it
flows by gravitation to all parts of the city and the
suburbs.&nbsp; The present company has a capital of &pound;60,000
in &pound;10 shares, and was incorporated under an act of
parliament passed in 1850, the powers of which have been enlarged
by subsequent <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>acts, so that wholesome and pure water is now
constantly supplied at very low terms.&nbsp; Excellent provision
has also been made for a plentiful supply for extinguishing
fires, by fixing hydrants at every 100 yards.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Old Palace</span>, where the
celebrated Bishop Hall resided, (now known as the Dolphin Inn,)
is in this hamlet.&nbsp; Here he retired after his expulsion from
the bishop&rsquo;s palace by the republican party in 1644.&nbsp;
The house, which is fast going to decay, displays the
peculiarities of the domestic architecture of the time of James
I.&nbsp; The front presents two projecting bays, one on each side
of the door, which afford a light to the lower and upper
rooms.&nbsp; The doorway deserves a passing notice, and some
curiously carved heads will <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>be found in the interior, as well as
the remains of an ancient piscina in the wall at the
entrance.&nbsp; There is a large parlour on the right hand,
wainscotted all round from the floor to the ceiling.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <span class="smcap">New Workhouse</span> was erected in
1859 at an expense of &pound;33,000 exclusive of &pound;680 paid
for about nine acres of land.&nbsp; It is an extensive range of
brick buildings in the Tudor style of architecture, having room
for about 1000 inmates, but it has never had so many as yet,
though the number is increasing every year.&nbsp; The debt on the
building was &pound;22,000, and will be gradually paid off by
instalments.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <span class="smcap">New Cemetery</span>.&nbsp; The
greatest improvement effected in Norwich during the present
century was the closing of all the churchyards for burials, and
the opening of a new cemetery for the dead.&nbsp; It was opened
in 1856 and is pleasantly situated on high ground next the
Earlham Road; the whole area being divided into two parts, one
side being consecrated and the other unconsecrated.&nbsp; The
whole comprises 35 acres of land prettily laid out and
planted.&nbsp; It was formed at a cost of &pound;7000 by the
Burial Board.&nbsp; There are entrances from the Earlham and
Dereham Roads.&nbsp; The two principal chapels are of early
English architecture with porches and apsidal terminations.&nbsp;
There is also a small chapel for the use of the Jews.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The long contemplated division of this extensive hamlet into
three parishes, has at length been carried <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>into
effect.&nbsp; The old church of St. Bartholomew is to be the
parish church of the new parish of that name on the north side
next the river.&nbsp; The estimated population is 5,600.&nbsp;
The Rev. J. G. Dixon is rector.&nbsp; The central part of the
hamlet, lying between the Dereham and Earlham Roads, with a
population of 4,400, is to form the new parish of St. Philip; but
a church has not been yet built.&nbsp; The third parish, the
incumbency of which is retained by the Rev. C. T. Rust, includes
all that part of Heigham which lies between Earlham Road and the
boundary of St. Stephen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The population is about
6,400.&nbsp; The church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in Essex
Street, is the parish church.&nbsp; The church of St. Bartholomew
stands on an eminence above the Wensum, and is a small structure
in the perpendicular style, with a nave, south aisle, north
porch, chancel, and a square tower, in which are three
bells.&nbsp; It has a mural monument to the pious Bishop Hall,
who was buried here in 1656.&nbsp; The living is a rectory valued
in K.B. at &pound;6 13s. 4d., and now at a little over
&pound;200.&nbsp; Trinity Church, near Unthank&rsquo;s Road, was
built by subscription, and consecrated in August 1861, to supply
the great want of church accommodation which had long been felt
in this part of the hamlet.&nbsp; It is a large building in the
decorated style, and consists of nave, transepts, and apsidal
chancel, with a tower containing one bell, and surmounted by a
slated spire 120 feet high.&nbsp; The total cost was
&pound;7000.</p>
<p>In 1861, an ancient lead coffin, containing the remains of a
female skeleton, was discovered about <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>four feet below the surface on a
chalk pit at Stone Hills, Heigham.&nbsp; It was perfectly plain,
and appeared to have been formerly enclosed in an outer case of
wood, and was probably of the Roman period.&nbsp; Near it were
found two bronze torque rings of a twisted pattern, encrusted
with a fine green patina, and evidently of the Anglo-Saxon
period.</p>
<h5><i>Hellesdon</i>.</h5>
<p>Hellesdon, adjoining Heigham, is a small and pretty village on
an eminence two miles north-west of the city, but the parish is
partly in Taverham hundred.&nbsp; It adjoins the river, which is
here crossed by a cast-iron bridge, built by the corporation of
Norwich in 1819.&nbsp; The common was enclosed in 1811.&nbsp; The
Bishop is lord of the manor and owner of a great part of the
soil.</p>
<h5><i>Earlham</i>.</h5>
<p>Earlham is a very pleasant village, situated at the end of the
Earlham Road.&nbsp; The ivy-mantled church is a very ancient
building of small size.&nbsp; The hall, situated in a park, is
associated with the honoured name of Gurney, and will long be an
object of deep interest.&nbsp; Amongst other members of that
distinguished family who resided here was the deservedly esteemed
Joseph John Gurney, who often entertained many of the celebrities
of his day.&nbsp; It was here that Wilberforce, Chalmers, and a
host of worthies, well known to fame, visited one of the happiest
of the homes of England, <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>where the sterling character of
Thomas Fowell Buxton was formed and matured, and where he met
with the partner of his future life.&nbsp; It was the birthplace
of Elizabeth Fry the philanthropist, of whom there is yet no
monument in this city.</p>
<h5><i>Eaton</i>.</h5>
<p>The hamlet of Eaton, two miles south-west of Norwich, is in
the vale of the Taas.&nbsp; The manor is about 1300 acres, and
belongs to the Dean and Chapter, but the soil is let to a number
of lessees, many of whom have handsome houses in the Newmarket
Road, one of the finest approaches to the city.&nbsp; Indeed,
this road may be called the &ldquo;west end&rdquo; of
Norwich.&nbsp; Eaton church is dedicated to St. Andrew, and is a
long ancient building covered with thatch, and having an
embattled tower with three bells.&nbsp; It was originally a
Norman structure, but it appears to have been rebuilt in the
early English period, and to have been considerably altered in
the 15th century.&nbsp; About two years ago the church was
thoroughly restored at a cost of about &pound;400, when a number
of beautiful mural paintings were discovered, some of them well
preserved.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage not in charge, valued
at &pound;87, and augmented in 1732 with &pound;200 given by the
Earl of Thanet, and &pound;200 of Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty.</p>
<h5><i>Lakenham</i>.</h5>
<p>Lakenham is the next hamlet on the south side of the city, and
the roads to it are favourite walks of the <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>citizens.&nbsp; Caister is an adjoining village, where
may be seen extensive remains of a Roman camp, built before
Norwich existed.&nbsp; The configuration of the camp may still be
traced as a parallelogram, enclosing an area of 32 acres,
sufficient for a force of 6000 men.&nbsp; On the western side,
which was washed by the Taas, formerly stood the water gate, with
a round tower, where vessels used to unload.&nbsp; A very large
number of Roman coins have been dug up here.&nbsp; Returning to
the hamlet of Lakenham, we ascend a hill called Long John&rsquo;s
Hill.&nbsp; Lakenham church stands on high ground above the river
Taas, and is a small structure dedicated to St. John the Baptist
and All Saints.&nbsp; It has a tower with three bells.&nbsp; The
benefice is a vicarage united to Trowse Newton, and with it
valued at &pound;261, in the patronage of the Dean and Chapter,
and incumbency of the Rev. Alfred Pownall, M.A.</p>
<p>St. Mark&rsquo;s Church, in Lakenham, was consecrated
September 24th, 1844, and is a neat structure in the
perpendicular style, comprising a nave without aisles, and an
embattled tower with turrets, pinnacles, and three bells.&nbsp;
It was built by subscription at a cost of &pound;4000, and
contains 900 sittings, most of which are free.&nbsp; The interior
has commodious galleries, and is neatly fitted up.&nbsp; Ladies
presented the communion table, plate, books for divine service,
font, &amp;c.&nbsp; The population in this hamlet has increased
from 428 in 1801 to 4866 in 1861.&nbsp; The perpetual curacy,
valued at &pound;150, is in the patronage of the Dean and
Chapter.&nbsp; The Rev. N. T. Garry, M.A., is incumbent.</p>
<h5><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span><i>Trowse-Millgate</i>, <i>Carrow</i>, <i>and
Bracondale</i>.</h5>
<p>Trowse-Millgate, Carrow, and Bracondale, extend southward from
King Street to the river Yare, opposite Trowse Newton.&nbsp; They
form one hamlet, though each division had formerly a parochial
chapel.&nbsp; Miss Martineau owns the greater part of the soil,
and lives at Bracondale Lodge, a handsome mansion with delightful
pleasure grounds.&nbsp; The late P. M. Martineau collected here
many remnants of Gothic architecture in 1804, and used them in
the erection of a lofty arch and an edifice, representing a small
priory with windows filled by stained glass.</p>
<h5><i>Thorpe</i>.</h5>
<p>The hamlet of Thorpe, one of the most delightful suburbs of
the city, lies on the south-east side, opposite Foundry Bridge,
and extends to Mousehold Heath.&nbsp; It contains many handsome
villas, which are mostly surrounded by gardens.&nbsp; Many of the
city gentry reside in this pleasant hamlet, which now contains
about 3000 inhabitants.&nbsp; The church, dedicated to St.
Matthew, was built in 1852 at a cost of &pound;2300, for an
ecclesiastical district, comprising that part of Thorpe parish
within the city liberties, containing about 2500
inhabitants.&nbsp; It is a neat structure in the Norman style of
architecture, from a design by Mr. Kerr, formerly architect of
this city.&nbsp; It consists of a nave, transepts, and apsidal
chancel, and is a unique structure.&nbsp; The five windows of the
chancel are filled with <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>stained glass.&nbsp; The rector of
Thorpe is patron of the perpetual curacy, valued at &pound;130,
which is now held by the Rev. George Harris Cooke, M.A., who has
a handsome parsonage house, erected in 1863 at a cost of
&pound;1400, in the Tudor style.</p>
<p>The road from the Foundry Bridge to Thorpe village is a
favourite walk of the citizens.&nbsp; Thorpe lodge (the entrance
to which is guarded by couchant lions, and is a conspicuous
object on the left,) was the residence of the late John Harvey,
Esq., &ldquo;a fine old English gentleman,&rdquo; who was a great
promoter of manufactures, and of aquatic sports.&nbsp; Its
present proprietor and occupant is Donald Dalrymple, Esq.&nbsp;
The old hall, the name by which the manor house is now known,
stands at the entrance to the village.&nbsp; It was formerly the
country seat of the bishops.&nbsp; Adjoining are the remains of a
chapel, now used as a coach house and stable.&nbsp; On the south
side of the river, which was once reached by the ferry boat,
stands the village of Whitlingham, where the citizens formerly
resorted by thousands in the summer months.&nbsp; The grounds in
this locality present a pleasing variety of hill and dale, wood
and water, and the view from the White House includes the
windings of the &ldquo;bonny Yare,&rdquo; the opposite village of
Thorpe, the spire of the Cathedral rising above the distant
hills, and the frowning aspect of the old Norman Castle.&nbsp;
The whole of the land here now belongs to R. J. H. Harvey, Esq.,
M.P., who has greatly improved an estate of 2000 acres next the
river.&nbsp; He has often thrown the grounds open to the
citizens.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>The
Rosary Burial Ground, in Thorpe hamlet, was established in 1819
by the late Rev. Thomas Drummond, for the use of
Dissenters.&nbsp; Being aware that many of the burial grounds
attached to their chapels are held on leases under the
corporation, he urged the necessity of a general cemetery on
freehold land, so securely vested in trust that it could not be
converted to other uses at any future time.&nbsp; The Rosary
occupies eight acres of land in a good situation.&nbsp; It is
divided into sections separated by plantings of trees or shrubs,
and contains a small chapel.&nbsp; It is not consecrated, and
ministers of any denomination may officiate at funerals.&nbsp; In
this beautiful resting-place for the dead are deposited the
remains of many of the worthiest of the Norwich citizens.</p>
<h5><i>Pockthorpe</i>.</h5>
<p>Pockthorpe was originally part of Thorpe, but when severed in
the time of the Conqueror, with the parishes of St. James and St.
Paul, took the name of Paucus Thorpe or Little Thorpe, corrupted
into Pockthorpe.&nbsp; The place is apparently wedded to poverty,
with no Divorce Court to grant it relief.&nbsp; It is chiefly
inhabited by poor weavers or spinners, who still adhere to an old
pastime, the rearing of pigeons, as appears from many coops at
the broken windows.&nbsp; The brewery here is an old
well-established concern, and sends out about 100,000 barrels of
beer yearly.</p>

109</span>NONCONFORMISTS&rsquo; CHAPELS.</h3>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Old Meeting House</span>, Colegate
Street, was erected in 1693 by the Independents, a congregation
of which body had existed in Norwich since the
Commonwealth.&nbsp; They had originally assembled in a brewery in
St. Edmund&rsquo;s, and afterwards in the &ldquo;west
granary&rdquo; of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; Mr. Bridge, the
first pastor, who was incumbent of St. George&rsquo;s, Tombland,
seceded from the church in the reign of James II., and sat in the
Westminster Assembly of Divines.&nbsp; The building is a large
structure of red brick, fronted with four Corinthian
pilasters.&nbsp; It contains sittings for 700 persons, and has
spacious schoolrooms adjacent.&nbsp; The Rev. John Hallett is the
present minister.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Prince&rsquo;s Street Chapel</span>
(Independent) was erected in 1819.&nbsp; It is a handsome
building of white brick, and has been enlarged and almost rebuilt
at a cost of &pound;2000, under the superintendence of Mr.
Boardman, architect, of this city.&nbsp; It will now accommodate
1000 persons.&nbsp; The new front presents an elevation in the
modern Italian or composite style, with seven windows of
ornamental design.&nbsp; The roof has been raised and new windows
inserted, eight on each side.&nbsp; New galleries have been
erected with cast-iron columns, and ornamental iron front.&nbsp;
A new apse has been added, and a vestry or retiring room at the
back.&nbsp; The whole interior has been reseated with plain open
benches.&nbsp; The entrances, staircase, hall, and avenues, are
laid with tessellated tiles.&nbsp; At a <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>short
distance from the chapel there is a spacious schoolroom, with
class rooms on each side.&nbsp; The Rev. G. S. Barrett is the
present minister.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Chapel in the Field</span>,
(Independent) opened in 1858, is a handsome edifice with two
imposing spiral turrets.&nbsp; Its arched interior has a fine
effect, increased by the introduction of four painted windows in
the apse.&nbsp; The building affords sittings for 900
persons.&nbsp; Adjoining are spacious schoolrooms in a similar
style of architecture.&nbsp; The Rev. Philip Colborne is the
present minister.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Tabernacle</span> (Lady
Huntingdon&rsquo;s Connexion) is situate near St. Martin&rsquo;s
at Palace.&nbsp; It was built by the Calvinistic Methodists,
under Mr. Wheatley, in 1772, at a cost of &pound;1752.&nbsp; In
1775, the Tabernacle was sold to the Countess of Huntingdon, who
visited Norwich in the following year, and vested the building in
trust with four clergymen and three laymen of the same connexion
to appoint ministers whose preaching and sentiments are according
to the articles and homilies of the church of England.&nbsp; It
contains 1000 sittings.&nbsp; The Rev. Burford Hooke is the
present minister.&nbsp; There is also another chapel of the same
connexion on the Dereham Road, of which the Rev. John Joseph
James Kempster is the minister.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Mary&rsquo;s Chapel</span> (Baptist)
was originally erected in 1714, but was rebuilt in its present
style in 1811 and enlarged in 1838.&nbsp; Rev. Joseph Kinghorn
was <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>pastor from May 20th, 1791, till his death, on
September 1st, 1832.&nbsp; Rev. William Brock was pastor from
1833 to 1848, when he resigned his charge and went to London,
where he preaches at Bloomsbury chapel.&nbsp; Since 1849, the
Rev. G. Gould has been the pastor.&nbsp; Spacious schoolrooms
adjoining the chapel are now in course of erection.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Clement&rsquo;s</span> (Baptist) was
erected in 1814 and contains 900 sittings, and there is a
spacious schoolroom adjacent.&nbsp; The celebrated Mark Wilks was
once the pastor.&nbsp; The present minister is the Rev. T.
Foston.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Ebenezer Chapel</span> (Baptist), on
Surrey Road, was built in 1854, the minister being the Rev. R.
Govett, who some years since seceded from the established
church.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Gildencroft</span> (Baptist), in St.
Augustine&rsquo;s, formerly occupied by the Society of Friends,
was erected in 1680.&nbsp; There is a spacious burial ground
attached, in which lie the remains of Joseph John Gurney, Mrs.
Opie, and other eminent Friends.&nbsp; The Rev. C. H. Hosken is
the minister.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Orford Hill Chapel</span> (Baptist) was
opened as a chapel in 1832.&nbsp; The Rev. J. Brunt is the
present minister.</p>
<p>There are also Baptist Chapels in Cherry Lane, (Rev. W.
Hawkins); this was formerly a Wesleyan <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Chapel in
which the Rev. John Wesley preached; Priory Yard, (Rev. R. B.
Clare); Pottergate Street, (Rev. H. Trevor); and Jireh Chapel,
Dereham Road, (no regular pastor).</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Presbyterians</span> recently
purchased St. Peter&rsquo;s Hall, in Theatre Street, as a place
of worship.&nbsp; The hall contains about 700 sittings, which are
generally all occupied.&nbsp; The Rev. W. A. Mc Allan was
ordained minister in 1867, and he preaches with great success to
large congregations.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Wesleyans</span>.&nbsp; The Revs. John and
Charles Wesley paid their first visit to this city in 1754, but
their followers had no settled place of worship here till 1769,
when they built a small chapel in Cherry Lane, where the late Dr.
Adam Clarke was stationed in 1783, and began to display that vast
genius which afterwards astonished the religious world.&nbsp; The
Wesleyan Methodists have two chapels, one a very spacious edifice
in Lady Lane, and the other, just finished, in Ber Street.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <span class="smcap">United Methodist Free Church</span>
has two chapels.&nbsp; That in Calvert Street was erected by the
Wesleyan Methodists in 1810, and is a large brick edifice with
about 1200 sittings, and two houses for the ministers.&nbsp; The
other is in Crook&rsquo;s Place, Heigham, and was opened in 1839,
and contains 800 sittings.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Primitive Methodists</span> have
chapels on St. <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Catherine&rsquo;s Plain, Cowgate Street, and Dereham
Road.&nbsp; The first named, called Lakenham Chapel, was built in
1835, and contains 600 sittings.&nbsp; The second, in Cowgate
Street, was built about 20 years since, and contains 300
sittings.&nbsp; The third, on Dereham Road, was built in 1864, on
the site of a smaller one, at a cost of &pound;1316, raised by
subscription.&nbsp; Sunday schools are connected with all these
chapels.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Unitarians</span> occupy the <span

handsome building, of the shape implied by its name.&nbsp; It is
surmounted by a dome, supported by eight Corinthian
pillars.&nbsp; It was erected in 1756, on the site of the old
Presbyterian Meeting-house.&nbsp; Dr. John Taylor, and Dr.
Enfield (compiler of the Speaker) preached in this chapel.&nbsp;
Rev. D. H. Smyth is the minister.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Society of Friends</span> have a

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Roman Catholics</span> have two
chapels.&nbsp; In the last century there was a chapel connected
with the palace of the Duke of Norfolk on the site of the present
Museum, but it was lost when that property was sold by him.&nbsp;
The Roman Catholics raised a subscription and built their present
chapel in St. John&rsquo;s Maddermarket in 1794.&nbsp; It is
merely a plain building, but the altar is very handsome.&nbsp; It
contains sittings for about 600 people.&nbsp; The services <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>here are
carried out with great solemnity, and with a strict adherence to
the ritual of the Church of Rome.&nbsp; There is generally a
large congregation at divine service.&nbsp; The Rev. Canon Dalton
is the officiating priest.&nbsp; He resides near the chapel in a
very ancient building that was occupied by the City Sheriff in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; The chapel in Willow Lane,
called the Chapel of the Apostles, is a handsome building,
erected in 1828.&nbsp; The windows are of stained glass, and the
interior decorations are very striking.&nbsp; This chapel is
served by Fathers of the Society of Jesus, commonly called
Jesuits.&nbsp; It is the custom of that order to change the
officiating clergy every few years.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Lane of
the order was a contemporary of the Rev. Mr. Beaumont, the first
priest of St. John&rsquo;s chapel, during the greater part, if
not all, of that gentleman&rsquo;s lengthened ministry of 62
years, and died about the same time.&nbsp; The congregation is
generally larger than at St. John&rsquo;s Chapel.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Free Christian Church</span>.&nbsp; The
Dutch Church, in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, originally the
Conventual Church of the Black Friars, was granted to the Walloon

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4>Norwich Antiquities.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Castle, Cathedral, and churches
already described are the chief antiquities of the city, but
other remains are worthy of notice, and have been described by
Blomefield, Kirkpatrick, Taylor, Harrod, S. Woodward, B. B.
Woodward, the Rev. R. Hart of Catton, R. Fitch, Esq., and other
antiquaries, who have explored every part of the old city.&nbsp;
They nearly all agree in their accounts of the rise and progress
of Norwich, and of its condition at different periods.</p>
<h5><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>THE
ANCIENT CITY.</h5>
<p>B. B. Woodward, Esq., F.S.A., delivered two lectures on
&ldquo;Norwich in the Olden Time,&rdquo; to the members of the
Church of England Young Men&rsquo;s Society, at the Assembly
Rooms, some years since.&nbsp; He showed a thorough knowledge of
all the previous authorities, with whom he sometimes
differed.&nbsp; He exhibited four large maps, presenting views of
the Old City at different periods, from <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 400 to <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1400.&nbsp; He stated that he had
derived the greater part of his materials for them from the
series of maps of ancient Norwich made by his father, the late
Mr. S. Woodward, but he had corrected and completed them from the
publications of various Arch&aelig;ological Societies since they
had been constructed, and he hoped that they would serve to
illustrate the growth and progress of the ancient city with
general fidelity to facts.&nbsp; Directing attention to the first
map, which represented the condition of the <i>Venta
Icenorum</i>, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 400, Mr.
Woodward pointed out the purely fictitious character of the
earliest accounts of Norwich to be found in the older historians,
who drew, in all good faith, on their fertile imaginations, and
both persuaded themselves that they were writing history, and
that they were believed to be doing so by others.</p>
<p>The old-established tradition, that the sea came up to
Norwich, he stated, was undoubtedly to be accepted, but not as
having occurred within the historic period.&nbsp; From various
facts, and particularly from the occurrence of a Roman road at
Wangford, near Bungay, <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>near the edge of the present stream,
he concluded that in the times of the Romans, the valleys of the
Eastern Counties did not present a very different aspect from
their present one, though of course where there was now meadow,
marsh existed formerly, and many small streams have
disappeared.&nbsp; Mr. Woodward, on this point, differed entirely
from all the local historians and antiquarians, and his opinion
is not supported by any evidence.&nbsp; The existence of a Roman
road at Wangford, near Bungay, if such there be, has nothing to
do with the river Yare.&nbsp; Mr. Woodward offered no proof that
it is a Roman road.&nbsp; All the local historians state that a
broad arm of the sea flowed up to Norwich till the 11th century,
when Sweyn came up with a great fleet and landed an army
here.&nbsp; Parochial records prove that the river came up to St.
Lawrence Steps at a later period.&nbsp; We may therefore dismiss
this singular opinion as untenable.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodward regarded Norwich as the <i>Venta Icenorum</i> of
the Romans for several reasons, and particularly because it was
plain from the occurrence of these Ventas in Britain, and none in
any other part of the Roman world, that this was the name of a
British town, which its being called the Venta of the Iceni
strongly confirmed&mdash;even, in fact, a British stronghold,
constructed according to the custom of that people in parts of
the country without hills.&nbsp; In hilly countries the
strongholds were entrenchments round the summits of the hills,
but then there were small tracts of land surrounded by
marshes.&nbsp; Such were the British strongholds on Bungay
Common, and that at <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Horning, and such he believed was
the <i>Venta Icenorum</i>.&nbsp; They were not intended for
permanent occupation, but as places of safety for their wives and
children, and for their cattle, in case of the attack of another
tribe; and they could rarely be held against the enemy for any
length of time.&nbsp; In this instance, the trench was drawn in a
horse-shoe form, from the eastern slope of the ground on which
the Castle now stands to the western side, the steep bank of the
little stream, called the Cockey, being rendered more steep by
art, whilst the Wensum and marshes protected the other
sides.&nbsp; The position of the Roman camp, as the map showed,
was determined by its being the fittest for keeping in check the
<i>Iceni</i> of <i>Venta</i>, and preventing them from marching
against the southern part of the island; and it might probably
have been placed there after the disastrous experiment of what
the <i>Iceni</i> could do under such a leader as their famous
Queen Boadicea.&nbsp; In the latter part of the Roman period it
would seem that the conquerors had less occasion for mere
military force here, for the remains of a Roman villa had been
found in the northern side of the camp at Caister.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodward said the Map of Norfolk still showed traces of
Roman roads radiating from Norwich.&nbsp; The principal roads
were&mdash;one entering the stronghold in the western side, now
St. Stephen&rsquo;s Street; another entering it on the east, now
known as King Street.&nbsp; This last crossed the river by a ford
at Fyebridge, and was the origin of Magdalen Street and St.
Augustine&rsquo;s Street; another road left the fortress on the
western side, near the river, and was called St. Benedict&rsquo;s
<a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>Street;
and the last crossed the river at Bishopbridge by another ford,
and sent off branches to the north-east and east of
Norfolk.&nbsp; He believed that nearly all the main lines of road
originated with the Romans, but this is at least doubtful.&nbsp;
Norwich must then have been a very large town to have required so
many main lines of roads; but its very existence as a town is
uncertain during the Roman period.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodward&rsquo;s second map exhibited the entrenchments
round the fortress as already described, at the time of the
Conquest.&nbsp; Map the third exhibited the condition of the city
in the time of the Domesday Survey, or about <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1100, when 54 churches and chapels
existed.&nbsp; Map the fourth showed the state of the city <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1400, when Norwich was described as
at the acme of its splendour and importance, and second only to
Bristol, after London.&nbsp; This arose from its being the
capital of East Anglia, and the residence of so many of the
clergy and gentry.&nbsp; Mr. Woodward pointed out the sites of
some of the old monasteries in this period.&nbsp; The
Bishop&rsquo;s palace was then within the precincts of the
close.&nbsp; Besides the monastery there, and that of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s, there were then several others in Norwich.&nbsp;
In King Street, to the south of St. Faith&rsquo;s Lane, were the
Austin Friars, and to the north of Rose Lane the Grey
Friars.&nbsp; Both these monastic communities were said to have
encroached on the adjacent streets, churchyards, &amp;c., by
extending their precincts; which accounted for the changes around
them.&nbsp; The Carmelites occupied the whole angle of the city
between the river, the walls, <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>and Bargate Street.&nbsp; But few
traces of these establishments now remain.&nbsp; The case of the
Black Friars was very different.&nbsp; Their magnificent church
is still almost entire; much of the convent is still standing in
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, and the Dutch or Walloon Church, and the
oldest parts of the former Workhouse.&nbsp; In addition to these,
there had been several smaller monastic orders which were merged
in the others before the 15th century.&nbsp; In this period, most
of the streets on the north side of the town were in existence,
and some on the south side.</p>
<p>Formerly, as already intimated, some of our streets were named
from the trades of those who occupied them.&nbsp; Thus there were
Saddlers&rsquo; Gate, now White Lion Street; Wastelgate, now Red
Lion Street; Cordwainers&rsquo; Row, now part of the Walk;
Goldsmiths&rsquo; Row, north side of the Market; Hosiers&rsquo;
Row, in part of London Street; Cutlers&rsquo; Row, in part of
London Street; Hatters&rsquo; Row, now St. Giles&rsquo; Street;
Dyers&rsquo; Row, in St. Lawrence Street; and Pottergate Street,
still so called.&nbsp; The Cloth Hall stood in the Haymarket; and
on the west side were the Butchery, the Fishmarket, and various
other rows, where articles of food were sold.</p>
<h5>OLD WALLS AND GATES.</h5>
<p>R. <span class="smcap">Fitch</span>, <span
class="smcap">Esq</span>., is the very best authority respecting
the old walls and gates, of which he made a study for many years;
and in 1861 he published a very handsome illustrated volume
entitled, &ldquo;Views of the Gates <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>of Norwich made in the years
1792&ndash;3, by the late John Ninham; with an Historical
Introduction, Extracts from the Corporation Records, and Papers
by the late John Kirkpatrick, contributed to the Transactions of
the Norfolk and Norwich Arch&aelig;ological Society, by Robert
Fitch, F.S.A., F.G.S.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The history of the walls of Norwich is a
history of the gate houses, and in speaking of the origin of the
first we include that of the second.&nbsp; In 1294, being the
23rd Edward I., the first mural tax was granted, and continued
three years.&nbsp; A second tax succeeded this, and in 1304 a
third tax was imposed, to continue in operation for five
years.&nbsp; In the 11th of Edward II., a fourth tax of the like
nature was allowed; and in two years after, namely in 1319, the
walls of Norwich were completed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the thickness and extent of the fortifications of
this city are considered, it cannot be thought surprising that a
period of 25 years elapsed before these mural defences were
finished, so far as to render no additional tax necessary.&nbsp;
It must not, however, be considered that no other pecuniary
assistance was required towards the work.&nbsp; The citizens
themselves manifested the greatest interest in the subject; and
the ancient books of account contain not only entries of money
expended on the walls and gates, but also register the private
contributions of persons towards the same object and for
necessary reparation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been previously observed, that in 1319 the walls
of the city were said to have been completed; but something more
was required to render them adequate to the purpose for which
they were designed.&nbsp; Neither towers nor gates could be of
use unless properly furnished with munitions of <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>war and the
implements then in use for their projection.&nbsp; This does not
appear to have taken place until 23 years after completion,
namely in 1342, in 16th Edward III., when a patriotic citizen,
Richard Spynk, for the honour of the monarch and the safety of
his fellow citizens, gave thirty espringolds to cast stones with,
to be kept at divers gates and towers; 100 gogions, or balls of
stone, locked up in a box; a box with ropes and accoutrements;
four great arblasters, or crossbows, and 100 gogions for each
arblaster; two pairs of grapples, to bring the bows to the
requisite tension for discharge; also other gogions, and some
armour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After stating other acts of this citizen, Mr. Fitch
proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From this long recital of gifts, it must be
concluded that Richard Spynk was virtually the fortifier of the
city; for it is clear that until his munificence made the gates
and walls complete, they were imperfect.&nbsp; Nor did he suffer
his work to fall into decay; but by the adoption of rules and
regulations, he preserved to the city the full benefit of what he
had done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before proceeding further with an outline of the
history of the Walls and Gates, it should be stated that Norwich
had been previously surrounded by a ditch and bank for
protection.&rdquo; * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;One benefit produces another, and to Richard Spynk was
the City not only indebted for its safety from aggression, but
also for an extension of its liberties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is recorded that Queen Isabella induced the king,
her son, in consideration of the costs and charges for the Walls
which had been raised without call on the Government, to <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>grant a
charter to the Citizens, that they, and their heirs and
successors, dwelling in the said City, should for ever be free
from jurisdiction of the Clerk of the Market and of the household
of the King, and his heirs, so that the said Clerk or his
officers should not enter the City, or fee or make assay of any
measures or weights, or to exercise or do anything belonging to
the said office of the Clerk of the Market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this King&rsquo;s reign, according to the
Customs&rsquo; Book, there is an account of the battlements on
the various gates, towers, and walls.&nbsp; These were numbered,
in order that each parish might be made acquainted with its
responsibilities of repairs in this respect.&nbsp; Beginning from
the river to Coslany Gate, there were 112 battlements, and 10 on
the gate itself.&nbsp; From that point to St. Augustine&rsquo;s
Gate, were 69 battlements, and on the gate, 12.&nbsp; Thence to
Fibrigge Gate&mdash;on the walls and towers were 153 battlements,
and on the gate, 13; thence to Pockthorpe Gate&mdash;on the walls
and towers were 178, and on the gate, 10; and from this gate to
the river were about 40.&nbsp; From this point to the tower of
Conisford Gate, the river chiefly protects the city, but the
tower bore 12 battlements; and from the tower on the city side of
the water to Conisford Gate, were 26 battlements with 14 on the
gate.&nbsp; Thence to Ber Street Gate, were 150; on the gate and
its wicket were 27; and from thence to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Gate
were 307 (here were some strong towers); and on this gate and
wicket were 28.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From St. Stephen&rsquo;s to St. Giles&rsquo; Gate were
229 (here again were several strong towers), and on the gate and
wicket were 15; and from St. Giles&rsquo; to St. Benedict&rsquo;s
Gate were 100, and on the gate itself and wicket were 16; thence
to Heigham Gate 79, and on the gate 4&mdash;and from this gate to
the tower and wall on the river were 16 battlements; in all,
1630.&nbsp; At this period (1345, according to the Domesday <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Book of the
City) there was a tax called &lsquo;Fossage,&rsquo; to defray the
great charges of the walls and ditches.&rdquo;&nbsp; * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1385 a general survey was made, and all the walls
and gates were placed in good repair, with a sufficient number of
men appointed to guard them.&nbsp; It was also agreed that
churchwards should be chosen annually, whose duty it should be to
prevent any decay or permanent injury to the fortifications by
timely repair or by reconstruction.&nbsp; In 1386, the expectancy
of invasion caused general fear throughout the realm, and
particularly in the eastern counties.&nbsp; The king sent nearly
a thousand men to Yarmouth for the defence of the coast; and so
imminent was the peril, that the king commanded the authorities
of Norwich to place the walls, towers, and gates in full and able
condition to repel all who might appear in opposition to the
king&rsquo;s authority, or crush a design to injure the
city.&nbsp; The towers were therefore filled with engines of
defence, the walls rendered perfect, and the ditches made as wide
and as deep as the necessities of the case demanded.&rdquo; * * *
*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author proceeds to show the anxious attention which was
paid to the preservation of the walls and gates, by copious
extracts from a roll, dated 1386.&nbsp; He then gives a full
history of the fortifications, from which we shall make some
extracts in our narrative of events at different periods.&nbsp;
He thus concludes his historical sketch:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not a fragment of the gates now exists, but
the certain indications of where, in some instances, they once
stood, are yet accidentally preserved.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a short notice of these, the account is
concluded:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Conisford Gate</span>.&nbsp;
A fragment of the wall of the east side of this gate still
exists, attached to the west of the &lsquo;Cinder Ovens&rsquo;
public house at the south end of King Street, and also on the
opposite side of the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Ber Street Gate</span>.&nbsp; No
portion of this gate remains; but where the structure stood is
sufficiently evident by the high wall on the west side of the
upper end of Ber Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Brazen Doors</span>.&nbsp; Not a
fragment remains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">St. Stephen&rsquo;s
Gate</span>.&nbsp; No portion left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">St. Giles&rsquo; Gate</span>.&nbsp;
The house against which the south side of this gate abutted still
stands, and part of the lower walls of the building can be seen.
<a name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126"
class="citation">[126]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">St. Benedict&rsquo;s
Gate</span>.&nbsp; Here a corresponding house or abuttal of this
gate stands perfect, with one of the strong iron staples, on
which hung one of the doors, projecting from the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Heigham Gate</span>.&nbsp; Very
slight remains left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">St. Martin&rsquo;s
Gate</span>.&nbsp; A portion of the north side of this gate is
left erect and firm, with small tenements abutting against it</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">St. Augustine&rsquo;s
Gate</span>.&nbsp; No fragment is left.&nbsp; A large portion of
the ditch between this gate and St. Martin&rsquo;s is clearly
seen, very few buildings having been erected on its site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Magdalen Gate</span>.&nbsp; No
portion left, but the form and interior of the city wall is well
seen at this point.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Barre</span> or <span
class="smcap">Pockthorpe Gate</span>.&nbsp; Indications are left
of where the gate stood, with fragments of the wall on the right
and left</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Bishop&rsquo;s Gate</span>.&nbsp;
Nothing of the gate exists, but the exact site may be seen by the
necessary increased width of the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The precise spot where each gate stood may be found by
tracing a line of the city wall, where it crossed a street; the
gates being of course integral portions of the wall perforated
for traffic and fortified with extra work for adequate
defence.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>DESECRATED CHURCHES.</h4>
<p>The Rev. Francis Blomefield, of Fersfield, who flourished in
the first half of the last century, was the chief of Norfolk
historians and antiquarians.&nbsp; He was great in genealogy and
heraldry, and very elaborate on monuments and epitaphs, while he
altogether passed over more important matters.&nbsp; We might
almost wish that he had known less of heraldry and more of
history; but his great work must ever be the foundation of local
history in Norwich and Norfolk.&nbsp; A perfect copy of his work,
being very scarce, is now worth at least &pound;20.&nbsp; It
contains most of the documentary antiquities of the city, such as
charters, acts of parliaments, proceedings of public bodies, and
other official sources of information, of which he has made a
good use.&nbsp; He has given full details from the records of
every parish, and of the old corporation.&nbsp; He <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>states the
great changes which took place in the city and county at the time
of the Reformation, and the dissolution of the monasteries, when
nineteen of those institutions existed in Norwich.</p>
<p>Blomefield notices several large conventual churches, which
were desecrated at the Reformation, and many parish churches
which have been demolished, their parishes being incorporated
with those now existing.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">All Saints</span>&rsquo;, situated in
Fyebridge Street, was at the north corner of the street called
Cowgate, at its entrance into Magdalen Street, and was built
before the Conquest.&nbsp; At the foundation of the cathedral it
was appropriated to the convent, and at the Reformation to the
dean and chapter.&nbsp; It was said to have had a very fine font,
erected in 1477.&nbsp; In 1550 the church was taken down, and the
parish, with that of St. Margaret, was annexed to St.
Paul&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s</span>, in Ber
Street, was in the patronage of the prior of Wymondham, and at
the Dissolution was consolidated with St. John&rsquo;s Sepulchre,
and the church taken down.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Bittulph&rsquo;s</span> stood in
Magdalen Street, a little north of Stump Cross.&nbsp; It was
founded before 1300 and was taken down in 1548, and the parish
united to St. Saviour&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Christopher&rsquo;s</span> stood on
the east side of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hill, and was one of the
oldest churches in <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>the city.&nbsp; It was burnt down in the reign of Henry
III.&nbsp; The greater portion of the parish was united to St.
Andrew&rsquo;s and a smaller part to St. Michael&rsquo;s at
Plea.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Crucis</span>, or St. Crowches, stood
in Broad Street, St. Andrew&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was dedicated to
the honour of the holy cross, and was erected before the year
1272.&nbsp; In 1551 it was desecrated, and the parish united to
St. John&rsquo;s Maddermarket.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Clement&rsquo;s</span>, in Conisford,
situated in King Street, was a very ancient church, founded long
before the Conquest.&nbsp; It was united with St. Julian&rsquo;s
in 1482.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s</span> was situated
at the north end of King Street, near Tombland.&nbsp; About 1492
it was united to the church of St. Mary the Less at the monastery
gates, and was demolished in 1530.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Edward&rsquo;s</span> stood on the
west side of King Street, near St. Etheldred&rsquo;s
church.&nbsp; About the end of the 13th century it was united to
St. Julian&rsquo;s.&nbsp; All along King Street there are many
vaults and crypts, which seem to have formed the foundations of
old churches and monasteries.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Faith&rsquo;s</span> or <span
class="smcap">St. Vedast&rsquo;s</span> was situated near the
place where Cooke&rsquo;s hospital now stands, in Rose
Lane.&nbsp; It was founded before the Conquest and was taken down
in 1540, the parish being united with that of <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>St. Peter
per Mountergate.&nbsp; The latter is a corruption of the old name
&ldquo;Parmenter Gate,&rdquo; which should be restored by
authority.&nbsp; It was the old Tailor Street.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Francis</span>&rsquo; belonged to the
Grey Friars, whose convent stood near the site of Cooke&rsquo;s
hospital.&nbsp; It was a noble church, 300 feet in length and 80
feet in breadth, with cloisters and a large chapter house.&nbsp;
At the Dissolution it was, with the convent, granted to the Duke
of Norfolk.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. James</span>&rsquo;, <span
class="smcap">Carrow</span>, belonged to the nunnery there, and
with it became private property at the Dissolution, the parish
being united to Lakenham.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. John&rsquo;s in Southgate</span> stood
at the north corner of Rose Lane, and about 1300 was annexed to
St. Peter Parmenter Gate.&nbsp; The Grey Friars pulled it down
and annexed the site of it to their convent.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. John the Baptist&rsquo;s</span> stood
on the site of the present Octagon chapel.&nbsp; It was
originally a parish church; but when the Dominicans, or
Friars&rsquo; Preachers, settled here in 1226, it was given to
them, and the parish was united to St. George&rsquo;s at
Colegate.&nbsp; They immediately built a convent in this place
and the church was used by them as a chapel, till they removed to
their new convent in St. Andrew&rsquo;s, where they dedicated
their church also to St. John the Baptist.&nbsp; The church is
now St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, and the chancel <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>(formerly
the Dutch church) is now the place of worship of the <span
class="smcap">Free Christian Church</span>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Margaret&rsquo;s</span>, <span
class="smcap">in Fyebridge</span>, was a church of ancient
foundation, situated on the west side of Magdalen Street, near
the gate.&nbsp; There is no account how long it has been
dissolved.&nbsp; The parish is now united with St.
Paul&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Margaret&rsquo;s at Newbridge</span>,
anciently called St. Margaret&rsquo;s at Colegate, was situated
near Blackfriars&rsquo; bridge, on the west side of the
street.&nbsp; The parish was depopulated by the great pestilence,
in 1349, when the church ceased to be parochial, and the parish
was annexed to that of St. George&rsquo;s Colegate.&nbsp; The
church occupied the site of Weston&rsquo;s brewery, now
demolished.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Martin&rsquo;s</span> in <span
class="smcap">Balliva</span> was situated near the spot where,
until lately, the Golden Ball tavern stood, on the south side of
the Castle Hill.&nbsp; The church was on the right hand of the
entrance into Golden Ball Lane.&nbsp; In 1562, this church was
demolished and the parish united to St. Michael&rsquo;s at
Thorn.&nbsp; Formerly all persons dying in the castle, and all
criminals executed, were buried in this churchyard, but this
right, after the desecration of the church, was conferred upon
St. Michael&rsquo;s at Thorn.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Mary the Virgin&rsquo;s</span> was
situated in Conisford, and belonged to the Augustine Friars,
being also <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>dedicated to St. Augustine.&nbsp; It was a noble
structure, 450 feet long and 90 feet wide, with cloisters on the
north and south sides.&nbsp; After the Dissolution it became
private property in 1547, when the church and conventual
buildings were demolished.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Mary Unbrent</span> stood on the west
side of Magdalen Street, near Golden Dog Lane.&nbsp; The church
was demolished at the dissolution, and the parish united to St.
Saviour&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unbrent&rdquo; means unburnt.&nbsp;
The church was called St. Mary <i>in combusto loco</i>, or in
that part of the city burnt in the great fire in the time of
William I.&nbsp; Blomefield thinks that the church was then
consumed, and afterwards rebuilt; and that it was erroneously
written in ancient documents <i>uncombusto</i>, instead of <i>in
combusto</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Matthew&rsquo;s</span>, near the
palace, was a small church.&nbsp; The parish has, since the great
pestilence of 1349, been united with that of St. Martin&rsquo;s
at Palace.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Michael&rsquo;s</span> in Coslany was
sold to the Austin Friars in 1360, and shortly afterwards the
parish was united to that of St. Peter Parmenter Gate, when the
church was demolished and a cloister erected on its site.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Olave&rsquo;s</span>, or St. <span
class="smcap">Tooley&rsquo;s</span>, stood on the east side of
Tooley Street, next to the corner of Cherry Lane.&nbsp; It was
demolished in 1546, and the parish consolidated with St.
George&rsquo;s Colegate.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span><span
class="smcap">St. Catherine&rsquo;s</span> in <span
class="smcap">Newgate</span> was situated on St.
Catherine&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; In 1349 the whole parish was almost
depopulated by the pestilence, after which the church was
deserted and converted into a chapel, the parish being united
with that of All Saints.&nbsp; At the Dissolution the chapel was
granted to Sir John Milton, and in 1567 conveyed to the city for
the use of St. Giles&rsquo; hospital.&nbsp; Thus a large amount
of Church property was applied to secular purposes.</p>
<h4>DESECRATED CHAPELS.</h4>
<p>Blomefield gives an account of different chapels dedicated to
various purposes, most of which were destroyed at the
Dissolution.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Catherine&rsquo;s Chapel</span> stood
upon Mousehold, about a mile north-east of the barracks, was
founded about the time of the Conquest, and was deemed a
parochial chapel while it was standing.&nbsp; At the Dissolution
this chapel was demolished and the parish united with that of St.
James.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Chapel of St. Thomas a Becket</span>,
which was not parochial, stood near the same place.&nbsp; No
traces of the building can now be discovered.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The College of St. Mary in the
Fields</span>, originally called the Chapel in the Fields (whence
the present name of Chapel Field was derived), was a chapel
dedicated to Mary the Virgin.&nbsp; It was founded <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>about the
year 1250, by <span class="smcap">John Le Brun</span>, as an
hospital, but its benefactors were so numerous and munificent
that in a very short time it became a noble college, consisting
of a dean, chancellor, precentor, treasurer, and seven other
prebendaries.&nbsp; Six chaplains or chantry priests were
afterwards added.&nbsp; The dean was collated by the bishop in
right of the see, or by the king during a vacancy.&nbsp; The
premises were very extensive, and were granted at the dissolution
to Miles Spencer, LL.D., the last dean.&nbsp; After passing
through many hands the property came into possession of
shareholders, who built Assembly Rooms on the site of the
college.&nbsp; Bond Cabbell, Esq. subsequently bought the whole
building for a Freemasons&rsquo; Hall.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Guildhall Chapel</span> adjoined the south
side of the hall, and was dedicated to St. Barbara.&nbsp; It
served as a chapel for the prisoners as well as for the Court to
attend divine service when they assembled on public
business.&nbsp; It was pulled down long since, and the present
porch was erected on its site.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Michael&rsquo;s Chapel</span>, <span
class="smcap">Tombland</span>, stood on the site of the obelisk,
and was one of the most ancient religious buildings in
Norwich.&nbsp; It was founded by the Earl of the East Angles long
before the Conquest and prior to the building of the Cathedral;
served as a chapel for the use of their palace, which stood
facing the south side of the chapel-yard; and occupied the south
end of Tombland, from the monastery gate to the chapel
ditch.&nbsp; Bishop Herbert demolished it, and <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>the whole
site was laid open for the improvement of the monastery, and a
stone cross was erected on the spot.&nbsp; Instead of this, the
Bishop built another chapel on the summit of the hill outside of
Bishopgate, and dedicated it to St. Michael.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Nicholas&rsquo; Chapel</span>,
Bracondale, was situated at the corner of the road now leading to
Carrow Bridge.&nbsp; It was much frequented by fishermen and
watermen, who were then numerous, and who made offerings there to
St. Nicholas, their patron saint.&nbsp; It was founded before the
Conquest and was parochial; but in the time of Edward II. the
parish was returned as belonging to Lakenham, with which it is
now united.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Olave&rsquo;s Chapel</span>, near King
Street Gates, was a parochial chapel long before the Conquest,
and in the reign of Edward III. the parish was united to that of
St. Peter Southgate.&nbsp; The chapel was demolished before
1345.</p>
<h4>MONASTIC INSTITUTIONS.</h4>
<p>Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Index Monasticus</i> contains the
fullest account of the old monasteries which, at one period, were
very numerous in the city.&nbsp; Many of them possessed large
churches, great wealth, and considerable power.&nbsp; They
comprised Priories, Friaries, and Nunneries, which were situated
in or near King Street, <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>or St. Faith&rsquo;s Lane, or the
Cowgate.&nbsp; Formerly all the west side of the river was called
the Cow-holm, where cows fed on the meadows, and Cowgate
consisted of open fields.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Priories</span>.</h4>
<p>The Benedictine Priory at the cathedral was founded by Bishop
Herbert as already noticed.&nbsp; The Priory of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s was founded by Bishop Herbert before he built the
cathedral, and here he placed the monks while the priory was
being built.&nbsp; It was situated on Mousehold Heath, opposite
Bishop&rsquo;s Bridge, and served as a cell to the cathedral
priory till the Dissolution.&nbsp; At the Dissolution it was
granted by Henry VIII. to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, whose son
Henry, Earl of Surrey, erected on its site a splendid house,
called Surrey house, which has long since fallen into
decay.&nbsp; St. Michael&rsquo;s Chapel, built by Bishop Herbert,
was near the priory, and served by monks.&nbsp; It was demolished
by the rebel Kett, who, with his followers, encamped near it, so
that it has since been called Kett&rsquo;s Castle.&nbsp; Near the
remains of this chapel, in the valley beneath, was
Lollard&rsquo;s Pit, the spot where many of the early Reformers
were burned.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Friaries</span>.</h4>
<p>This class of monastic institutions consisted of houses
erected for the Friars, of orders grey, or white, or black.&nbsp;
The monasteries were seldom endowed, <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>because the Friars were, by
profession, beggars, and lived on what they could get.&nbsp; They
obtained a great deal of money in the ages of superstition.&nbsp;
Many of their buildings were large and stately, and connected
with noble churches in which great personages were frequently
interred.&nbsp; Most of the monasteries were houses of refuge for
the destitute poor in the middle ages.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Grey or Franciscan Friars</span> seem
to have been the first who settled here near the site of
Cooke&rsquo;s Hospital about 1226.&nbsp; This convent was a place
of great resort, and the church, as already stated in our notice
of the Desecrated Churches, was a large building 300 feet in
length, and 80 feet in breadth, with spacious cloisters and
conventual buildings; not a stone of which now remains.&nbsp; One
of the cloisters of this convent was called &ldquo;Pardon
Cloister,&rdquo; on account of the pope granting indulgences to
all who were buried there, a source of revenue to the
monks.&nbsp; At the Dissolution the possessions were granted to
the Duke of Norfolk.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The White Friars</span> or <span
class="smcap">Carmelites</span> had a flourishing convent near
White Friars&rsquo; Bridge, which was founded by Philip de
Cowgate in 1256.&nbsp; He assumed the name from his estates,
being the principal person in those parts of the city.&nbsp; The
monks were called White Friars from their dress, and Carmelites
from the monastery of Mount Carmel in Palestine, the place of
their first residence, from which they were <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>driven by
the Saracens about the year 1238, after which they settled in
different parts of Europe.&nbsp; The monastery has been long
demolished, and the site built upon.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Black Friars</span>, sometimes called
the Dominican Friars or Friars&rsquo; Preachers, settled here
about 1226, in the church of St. John the Baptist, which formerly
stood in Colegate Street, on the site of the Octagon
Chapel.&nbsp; They afterwards removed into the parish of St.
Andrew, where they built a large monastery.&nbsp; The name of the
church is now St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin Friary</span>.&nbsp; The
possessions of this convent were bounded on the north by St.
Faith&rsquo;s Lane, and extended as far as the river.&nbsp; At
the Dissolution they were granted to Sir Thomas Heneage.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Friars De Domina</span> arose in 1288,
and in 1290 were introduced here.&nbsp; They had a house on the
south side of St. Julian&rsquo;s Churchyard, where they continued
till the reign of Edward III., when, all the brethren dying of
the great pestilence of 1348, their convent became private
property.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Friars of St. Mary</span> occupied a
house situated in the yard of the desecrated church of St. Martin
in Balliva, where the Golden Ball Tavern stood.&nbsp; They joined
the order of White Friars.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Friars De Pica</span> or <span
class="smcap">Pied Friars</span>, so called <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>from their
black and white garments, lived in a college at the corner of the
churchyard of St. Peter Parmentergate.&nbsp; They joined one of
the other orders.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Friars De Sacco</span>, or <span
class="smcap">Brethren</span> of the <span
class="smcap">Sac</span>, settled here about 1250 in a house
opposite to the church of St. Peter&rsquo;s Hungate.&nbsp; The
whole premises, bounded by Bridge Street on the west, by the
river on the north, and by the street leading to Hungate on the
south, were settled on them, where they built a church, dedicated
to the Virgin Mary, on the site of which St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall
now stands.&nbsp; The Black Friars were united with them in 1307,
when the convent was greatly enlarged, extending to the river on
the north side, and to Elm Hill on the east side.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A <span class="smcap">nunnery</span> formerly existed at
Carrow Abbey, dedicated to St. Mary and St. John.&nbsp; It was
founded in the year 1146 by two ladies named Leftelina and
Seyna.&nbsp; It was richly endowed by King Stephen, and consisted
of a Prioress and nine Benedictine Nuns, which number was
afterwards increased to twelve.&nbsp; The site within the walls
contained about ten acres of land, and the revenues and
possessions were great.&nbsp; At the Dissolution the abbey and
lands became private property.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Anchorages</span> or <span
class="smcap">Hermitages</span> were connected with several of
the monastic institutions in the city, and even inhabited by
recluses.&nbsp; Anchorets were a sort of <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>monks, so
called from their shutting themselves up in anchorages or
cells.&nbsp; Of these there were male and female, the eremite or
hermit, who pretended to follow the example of John the Baptist,
and the anchoress, who professed to imitate the conduct of
Judith.&nbsp; All these anchorages were abolished at the
Dissolution or at the Reformation.</p>
<h4>THE MONUMENTAL BRASSES OF NORWICH AND NEIGHBOURHOOD.</h4>
<p>To Arch&aelig;ologists, and particularly to those directing
their attention to Monumental Brasses, the following list of
Brasses in Norwich and the principal villages in the
neighbourhood, may be considered useful.&nbsp; They are
classified under their distinctive characters, namely&mdash;1st,
Ecclesiastics; 2nd, knights; 3rd, civilians and ladies; 4th,
miscellaneous.&nbsp; The list specifies those consisting of
effigies generally perfect, with their inscriptions, unless
otherwise mentioned.</p>
<p>An alphabetical list of the churches, with the various brasses
in each, is also appended.</p>

146</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
The Aborigines.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Norwich</span> is very remarkable for its
antiquities, its historical associations, its manufactures, and
its trade; and also for the eminent men who have flourished at
various periods in the city.&nbsp; It was the scene of many
important events in the times of the Iceni, the Romans, the
Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Danes, and Normans.&nbsp; It was the royal
seat of Anglo-Saxon princes.&nbsp; It was the Hierapolis
Monachopolis of the middle ages; famous for its churches and
convents; and in later times, celebrated for its Norman castle
and cathedral.</p>
<p>The first foundations of history are very often mere
traditions, which are transmitted from parents to their children,
from one generation to another.&nbsp; Probable only in their
origin, they become less probable in every succeeding age.&nbsp;
In process of time fable gains and truth loses ground.&nbsp;
Hence it is almost impossible to ascertain the origin of any
place claiming a high <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>antiquity.&nbsp; The early writers
could not divest their minds of the fascinating fables of
Geoffrey of Monmouth.&nbsp; In former times, when the power of
imagination prevailed, the distinction between legend and history
was scarcely recognised.&nbsp; For centuries there are not even
legendary accounts of East Anglia or of its capital.&nbsp; But
instead of legends, there are permanent memorials of the past;
great earthworks, fortifications, camps, strongholds, buildings,
churches, ruins of monasteries and abbeys.&nbsp; The soil has
yielded up relics of the dead&mdash;weapons, utensils, coins,
ornaments, and sepulchral urns, showing the presence of the
Iceni, the Romans, the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Danes, and Normans,
at different periods.&nbsp; All these energetic nations were
concerned in events that took place in Norfolk and Norwich.</p>
<p>The Iceni appear to have been politically independent up to
the period of the Roman invasion, <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span> 55.&nbsp; Their alarm in consequence
of that invasion led them to negociate an alliance, but we have
no reason to suppose that it was ever carried into effect.&nbsp;
They took the lead in a rebellion which the Roman General
Ostorius was barely able to quell; and Roman historians bear
testimony to the valour with which they struggled to maintain
their liberty.&nbsp; The superior discipline of the Roman
soldiers enabled them, however, to triumph over a semi-barbarous
people, unprotected by body armour and unused to military
tactics; but it was no easy victory.&nbsp; For about 600 years
after the defeat of the Iceni, no reliable information respecting
that people is to be found in any history.&nbsp; <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Indeed they
disappear from history altogether, and we can only infer what
advances they made in civilization from the scattered remains
that have been found in the eastern counties.&nbsp; These remains
prove that the Iceni were not semi-savages, but that they had
made some progress in useful arts, that they built houses, and
wore woven garments.</p>
<p>There are no remains in the eastern counties of cairns,
cromlechs, Druidical circles, or other memorials of ancient
perseverance and mechanical skill, nature having interposed an
absolute veto.&nbsp; But there are remains of earth works and
tumuli, burrows or artificial mounds in which were deposited the
urns or ashes of the dead.&nbsp; There are thousands of pits in
many places, and these are supposed to have been the foundations
of Icenian houses.&nbsp; Remarkable excavations are thickly
clustered all over Weybourne Heath, varying from 8 to 20 feet in
diameter, and from 2 to 6 feet in depth.</p>
<p>The Norwich Museum contains some remains of articles made by
the Iceni, amongst which may be mentioned sepulchral urns,
varying from the most primitive simplicity, up to forms and
patterns worthy of any age.&nbsp; The <i>chevron</i> ornament,
which is by far the most usual style of decoration, has been
traced not merely in India, Egypt, Etruria, and Nineveh, as well
as in Saxon and Norman work, but even among the works of ancient
American settlers in Yucatan!&nbsp; The Museum also contains
specimens of Icenic Celts or javelin heads, made of flints, which
appear to have been originally fitted on a wooden shaft or
handle, with a <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>provision for drawing it back after the infliction of
the wound, by means of a cord passing through the ring, as in the
metal specimens.&nbsp; It is probable that these flint specimens
were in use long anterior to the Roman invasion.</p>
<p>About 1844 or 1845, some discoveries were made in Norfolk of
gold torques and coins of the Iceni.&nbsp; In March 1855, at
Weston in Norfolk, 300 coins of the Iceni were found.&nbsp; The
most ordinary type is the rude representation of a horse on each
side; others have two crescents placed back to back; and on some
(in about the proportion of one in twenty,) is a rude profile of
a human head, while in a few instances there is a figure of a
wild boar.&nbsp; Beneath the horse in some cases are the letters
E C E or E C N, (supposed to be a contraction of Iceni,) also C E
A, T, A T D, A T E D, or A N T D, which antiquarians are as yet
unable to explain.&nbsp; Probably all the coins, like a single
coin which has been found of Boadicea, the unfortunate Queen of
the Iceni, were subsequent to the Roman invasion, for C&aelig;sar
expressly tells us that the Britons in his time used metal rings
instead of money, the value being determined by their weight; and
Camden, with great probability, supposes that most of the British
coins must have been struck as a sort of poll tax or tribute
money to the Romans.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the antiquities of the British period are
articles of the most urgent necessity, and of the rudest possible
form; but a long interval of tranquillity brought even luxuries
in its train, and it is a very remarkable fact that even the
lapse of 1800 years <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>has scarcely effected any change in
some articles of general utility.&nbsp; The discoveries made at
Herculaneum and Pompeii have led to a revival of the classical
forms, both in porcelain and in plate, the greatest practical
compliment that could be paid to the taste of the Roman
artists.</p>
<p>Among the objects which have been found at different places
may be mentioned sepulchral vases, varying, of course, in style
and taste, but in some instances most beautifully formed; funeral
lamps, lacrymatories, (or phials supposed to have contained the
tears of the sorrowing relations,) <i>fibul&aelig;</i> (or
brooches), gold rings, gold seals, steelyards, weights, tweezers,
a curiously formed brass lamp for three lights, a patera of
Samian ware, and coins of the Roman emperors.&nbsp; All these may
be seen in the Norwich Museum.</p>
<p>There is no evidence of the existence of Norwich as a city for
400 years after the Christian era.&nbsp; The whole island was a
howling wilderness, and Norfolk was a vast common, like Roudham
Heath.&nbsp; The natives lived by hunting or fishing, and
sheltered themselves in the woods, or in caves, or huts.&nbsp;
Water covered nearly all the area in which the city is now built,
and filled all the valley of the Yare.&nbsp; The aborigines,
called the Iceni, probably lived in huts near the banks of the
river, as it afforded a good supply of fish; but there is no
proof that they lived in any place that could be called a town or
even a village.&nbsp; There is in fact, no reliable account
whatever of the natives, how they lived, or where they <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>lived in
this district; for they have not even left any names of places,
and very few traces of any progress in the useful arts, and
certainly none of any buildings.&nbsp; On Mousehold Heath, near
the city, and at various places in the county, there are hollows
supposed to have been made by the Iceni as the foundation of
huts, or of houses of wicker work, or some other perishable
material, with a conical thatching at the top.&nbsp; Externally
they must have looked like very low bastions, having doorways,
but apparently neither chimneys nor windows.</p>
<h3><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
Norwich in the Roman Period.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Julius C&aelig;sar invaded the
island, <span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span> 55, he found seventeen
tribes of the ancient Britons or Celts, and the Iceni, inhabiting
this eastern district.&nbsp; They belonged to a very old family
of mankind, of whose beginning there is no record, and their end
is still more remote in the future.&nbsp; They first planted this
island and gave to the seas, rivers, lakes, and mountains names
which are poems, imitating the pure voices of nature.&nbsp;
Julius C&aelig;sar only made an inroad into the country through a
part of Kent, and gained no permanent hold of the island.&nbsp;
The Rev. Scott F. Surtees, in a recent work, maintains (and some
persons think successfully) that Julius C&aelig;sar effected his
first landing on the coast of Norfolk.</p>
<p>The Romans, under Claudius, landed on the eastern coast; and
established his power in this part of the country.&nbsp; He built
strongholds at Gorleston and camps at Caister, near the present
site of Yarmouth, and on the opposite shore at Burgh Castle,
where extensive ruins yet remain.&nbsp; Advancing up the arm <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>of the sea,
the Romans built a camp at Reedham; and sailing yet higher up
they built camps on the southern side of Norwich, at Caistor and
Tasburgh.&nbsp; Historians for a long time believed that Caistor
was the <i>Venta Icenorum</i> of the Romans, and preserved a very
ancient tradition, that Norwich was built of Caistor stone out of
the ruins of the Roman camp.</p>
<h4>THE VENTA ICENORUM.</h4>
<p>The late Hudson Gurney, Esq., collected ample materials for a
full history of Norwich, but the only result of his researches
seems to have been a letter to the late Dawson Turner, Esq., on
the question of the <i>Venta Icenorum</i> mentioned by the Roman
writers, whether it was Elmham, as Blomefield supposed, or
Caistor, as later historians believed, or Norwich, as most
antiquarians now think.&nbsp; The question is of some importance
as regards the antiquity of the city; for supposing it to have
been the <i>Venta Icenorum</i> of the Romans, with all the Roman
roads radiating from it, the <i>Venta</i> must have been a large
place.&nbsp; Main roads were of course made for traffic and for
means of communication, which imply the existence of many people
living in settled habitations.</p>
<p>Main roads prove a certain advance in civilization; but the
question is, whether the Romans really made all the roads
attributed to them, in Norfolk and Suffolk, during the four
hundred years of their occupation.&nbsp; Main roads might have
radiated from Caistor <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>originally, and afterwards might
have been diverted to Norwich.</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson Gurney adduced some proofs that Norwich and not
Caistor was the Venta Icenorum.&nbsp; He says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The first question to examine, on the view
of Norwich, Norwich Castle, and the Roman Camp at Caistor, may
be, whether Norwich or Caistor be the &lsquo;Venta
Icenorum&rsquo; of the Romans; Norwich standing on the Wensum,
and Caistor on the Taes, on the opposite side of what was the
great estuary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To begin, then, with Camden.&nbsp; In his accounts of
Norwich and of Caistor he falls into the most extraordinary
errors, confounding the courses of the three rivers, the Wensum,
the Taes, and the Yare.&nbsp; He places Norwich upon the Yare
instead of the Wensum, and gives the Wensum the course of the
Taes as &lsquo;flowing from the south;&rsquo; and still more
strangely, as a king-at-arms, he attributes the erection of the
present Castle of Norwich to Hugh Bygod, &lsquo;from the lions
salient carved in stone on it, which were the old arms of the
Bygods on their seals, though one of them bore a cross for his
seal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hudson Gurney remarks on this error&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now the lions were two lions passant
regardant, very rudely carved, one on each side of the arch of
the great entrance, and the Bygods, whose original arms were or,
a cross gules, never bore the lion till assumed by Roger Bygod in
the reign of Henry III., who took the arms of his mother, the
heiress of William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, in whose light he
became Earl Marshal of England.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>Thus
Camden is disposed of, and other authorities are quoted in the
letter in favour of Norwich being the Venta Icenorum.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Horsley, in his <i>Britannia Romani</i>,
states that Venta was the capital of the <i>Iceni</i>, situated
on the Wentfar, and thence deriving its name; and misled by and
quoting Camden, he places Venta at Caistor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;King, who, born in Norwich, might have been supposed to
have been better informed, in his <i>Munimenta Antiqua</i>
follows Camden, and turns the Taes into the Wensum; and in his
paper in the fourth volume of the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, he
pronounces the existing Castle of Norwich to be &lsquo;the very
tower which was erected about the time of King
Canute.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hudson Gurney, after setting aside Wilkins as an
authority, proceeds&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In 1834, I went over the Camp at Caistor
and the country adjacent, with Colonel Leake, who may be
considered the greatest living authority for the sites of ancient
cities and fortified camps, and he at once said that he was
convinced that Norwich was the <i>Venta Icenorum</i>, and capital
of the Iceni, and Caistor the fortified camp planted by the
Romans over against it, on the other side of the estuary, to
bridle, as was their custom, a hostile population.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After quoting a letter to the same effect, Mr. Hudson Gurney
continues&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the Roman Itineraries you have three
Ventas; Venta Bulgarum, Winchester; Venta Silurum, Caer Went, in
Monmouthshire; and Venta Icenorum; and of these <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>Ventas, the
confusion between Winchester and the Venta Icenorum seems to have
been begun very early, both with the chroniclers and romancers,
probably from the one having retained the rudiments of the name,
and the other becoming known as Northwic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Francis Palgrave, in the researches which he has
made for his forthcoming history of &lsquo;England under the
Normans,&rsquo; being led to the examination of all contemporary
authors, in order to clear up points which he found otherwise
inexplicable, has referred me to the two following passages,
which would seem to prove that Norwich was the Venta Icenorum
almost beyond dispute.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here follow Latin quotations from the life of William the
Conqueror by William of Poictiers and from Ordericus Vitalis
under the year 1067.</p>
<p>William of Poictiers says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gwenta urbs est nobilis atque valens, cives
ac finitimos habet divites, infidos, et audaces: Danos in
auxilium ceteris recipere potest: a mari quod Anglos a Danis
separat millia passuum quatuor-decim distat.&nbsp; Hujus quoque
urbis intra m&oelig;nia, munitionem construxit, ibidem Gulielmum
reliquit Osberni filium pr&aelig;cipuum in exercito suo, et in
vice sua interim toti regno Aquilonem versus
pr&aelig;esset.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Ordericus Vitalis states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Intra m&aelig;nia Gwent&aelig;, opibus et
munimine nobilis urbis, et mari contigu&aelig;, validem arcem
construxit, ibique Gulielmum Osberni filium in exercitu suo
pr&aelig;cipuum reliquit, eumque vice sua toti Regno versus
Aquilonem pr&aelig;esse constituit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>And
Mr. Gurney proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Taking, then, Norwich for the Venta
Icenorum of the Romans&mdash;called Caer Guntum by the British,
and Northwic by the Saxons and Danes&mdash;you find the Capital
of the Iceni, founded on the shoulder of the promontory
overlooking the Wensum, towards the great estuary, which formed a
natural stronghold for successive races of inhabitants.&nbsp;
Whilst the Romans, fixing their permanent camp at Caistor, on the
Taes, where that river joined the estuary, into which the Wensum,
the Taes, and the Yare, all discharged themselves, would command
the passage into the interior of the country; and taking Caistor
for the &lsquo;Ad Taum,&rsquo; you will find the distances
sufficiently to agree with the Roman Itineraries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Camp at Caistor contains an area of about
thirty-five acres, and the Roman station at Taesborough, on
another promontory higher up upon the stream, has an area of
about twenty-four acres.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another strong point in favour of Norwich having been the
Venta Icenorum is, that all the roads radiated from the city to
all parts of East Anglia.</p>
<p>In tracing the rise and progress of the city we must remember
that it was in the centre of a vast common, and that it was the
nucleus of an agricultural community, at first without any trade
or any kind of manufactures.&nbsp; It was merely a collection of
huts or a fishing station, near the banks of a river or arm of
the sea.&nbsp; The social state of the place should be considered
with reference to the progress of agriculture at different
periods in the surrounding district.&nbsp; Norwich was for ages
only a small market town, with a very small number of
inhabitants.</p>
<h3><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
Norwich in the Anglo-Saxon Period.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> destruction of all documents
relating to East Anglia, during the irruptions of the Danes, has
rendered this period the most obscure of any period of our
history.&nbsp; The Angles, Saxons, and Jutes having subjugated
the fair territory of England, they divided it into seven
kingdoms, called the Heptarchy, in which Norfolk formed a part of
East Anglia.&nbsp; The Anglo-Saxon leader, Uffa, established
himself in this part of the island, in 575; and assumed dominion
over that portion of the eastern district now divided into
Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire, giving it the name of East
Anglia, of which Norwich was made the metropolis.&nbsp; Norwich
was, therefore, a royal city, and the residence of the
kings.&nbsp; Uffa, the first king, is supposed to have formed
here a strong entrenchment of earth on the site of the present
castle, encircled by broad ramparts and a ditch, as under the
present Saxon arch.&nbsp; Uffa, who died <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 578, was succeeded by his son Titul;
on whose demise, in 599, his son Redwald assumed the reins of
government and embraced Christianity, but by the influence of his
wife <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>renounced it again.&nbsp; He was succeeded, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 624, by his son Erpenwald, who was
killed by a relation named Richbert, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 633.&nbsp; His half brother
Sigebert, who succeeded to the crown, established the bishopric
of Dunwich, in Suffolk, and formed the first seminary for
religious instruction, which led to the establishment of the
university in Cambridge.&nbsp; Fatigued with the crown and its
cares, he resigned it, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 644, to
his kinsman Egric, and retired into the famous monastery at Bury
St. Edmund&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Norwich then became one of the chief seats of Anna, king of
the East Angles, who gave the castle, with the lands belonging to
it, to his daughter Ethelfrida on her marriage with Tombert, a
prince of the <i>Gyrvii</i> or Fenmen, who inhabited the fens of
Lincolnshire and the adjacent parts of Norfolk.&nbsp; At the same
time Tombert granted to Ethelfrida, as a marriage settlement, the
isle of Ely, which for greater security was to be held by castle
guard service to the castle of Norwich.</p>
<p>From the time of Anna till the reign of Alfred the Great there
are few events on record except the frequent incursions of the
piratical Danes, who at last over-ran East Anglia, and had their
head quarters at Thetford in 870.&nbsp; But the reign of the
Great Alfred was distinguished by his decisive victories over
those Northern marauders.&nbsp; One of his chief objects was to
fortify the principal parts of his kingdom against hostile
attacks.&nbsp; Finding the walls or ramparts of Norwich Castle
too weak for repelling the attacks of the Danes, he caused others
to be erected with the <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>most durable materials.&nbsp; That
it was a noted military station, and a royal castle in his time,
is evident from a coin struck here in the year 872, having round
the head <i>AElfred Rex</i>, and on the reverse
<i>Northwic</i>.&nbsp; After making peace with the Danes in 878,
he assigned to them, for their residence, the whole of East
Anglia, and their leader Guthrum fixed his seat at Norwich; but,
breaking his faith, the city and county were wrested from him,
and reverted again to the Angles under six successive
sovereigns.</p>
<p>Edward the Elder succeeded his father, the illustrious Alfred,
in the year 901, and kept the Danes at bay.&nbsp; Ericke, one of
their chiefs, held East Anglia under the king, till he rebelled
in 913, when he was overthrown and slain.&nbsp; Athelstan, who
succeeded Edward, totally expelled the Danes, and reduced the
whole kingdom under his government.&nbsp; In his reign Norwich
flourished, and it is probable that he was here in 925, for a
coin still extant has on the obverse <i>Ethalstan</i>, and on the
reverse &ldquo;<i>Barbe Mon Northwic</i>,&rdquo; that is
&ldquo;Barbe, mint master of Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among the
other East Anglian coins struck here, the following may be
mentioned; one of Edmund, the successor of Athelstan, inscribed
round the head <i>Edmund Rex</i>, and on the reverse <i>Edgar Mon
Northwic</i>; several of Edred, coined about 946, and inscribed
round the head <i>Eadred Rex</i>, and on the reverse <i>Hanne Mo
Northwic</i>; two of Edward the Martyr, having on the obverse
<i>Edward Rex. Angl.</i> and on the reverse <i>Leofwine Mon
Nor.</i>; and three of Ethelred the Unready, having on the
obverse <i>Edelred Rex</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>There
is no account of the castle after the time of Anna till the
Danish wars; and then it was often won and lost by the contending
powers.</p>
<p>Blomefield, in his History of Norfolk, vol. II. p. 4, notices
the coins of several Anglo-Saxon princes, Alfred, Athelstan,
Edmund I., Edred, Edward the Martyr, and Ethelred II.&nbsp; The
circumstance of Alfred coining money here is remarkable, as at
the date of this coinage, (872) the government of East Anglia
could only have just come into his hands, upon the extinction of
the East Anglian dynasty in the person of St. Edmund, and the
country either was or had just been in the military possession of
the Danes.</p>
<p>During the reign of Athelstan the city appears to have been in
a flourishing state.&nbsp; In the reign of Edward, 941, and his
successor Edred, 945, it greatly increased in wealth and
extent.&nbsp; The greater part of the city was then built on the
north side of the river Wensum, with a small population.&nbsp;
The city is certainly of Anglo-Saxon origin, but as an
Anglo-Saxon city it was destroyed by the Danes, and no vestiges
remain of its Anglo-Saxon buildings, excepting, perhaps, one or
two round towers of churches.</p>
<h3><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
Norwich under the Danes.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Danes became settled in the
city, and fortified themselves against all enemies, about 1011;
and the next year, Turkil or Turketel, a Danish earl, took
possession of all Norfolk, having expelled the English Earl
Ulfketel, and held it under Sweyn till his death, which happened
in 1014.&nbsp; Then the Danish army chose Canute his son for
their king: but upon Sweyn&rsquo;s death the English took courage
and sent for Ethelred out of Normandy, who returned and drove
Canute out of the country.&nbsp; Turkel, however, continued
governor of the East Angles, and he persuaded Canute to return;
and he became king of England in 1017.&nbsp; That monarch
assigned all Norfolk to Earl Turkel; and according to the old
author of an Essay on the Antiquity of the Castle:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Committed to him the custody of Norwich,
which his father Sweyn burnt and destroyed; and to keep the East
Angles secure to him, he (Canute) was most like to be the builder
of the present stone Castle of Norwich.&nbsp; For when by compact
with the English nobles, the law called <i>Engleshire</i> was
made by universal consent, for the safety of the Danes <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>that were
by agreement to remain in England, Canute sent home to Denmark
his mercenary army of Danes, but in great caution built several
strong forts and castles, garrisoning them with such Danes as had
been settled in England before his time, intermixed with such
English as he had confidence in.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author of this ingenious Essay produces sufficient
arguments to show that there was a building in the fortifications
in the reign of Canute, and that there had been one since the
time of King Alfred, and that Canute might have repaired or even
rebuilt it.&nbsp; Indeed, there must have been a castle before
the Conquest, as in Domesday Book a number of tenements are
stated to have belonged to the castle.&nbsp; The present building
was probably reared after the Conquest, it being so like Rising
Castle and others.&nbsp; Roger Bigot very likely built it, and
Thomas Brotherton repaired it in the reign of Edward I., as
proved by his arms still in the stone work.&nbsp; Certain it is,
from the time of Sweyn&rsquo;s settling in the city in 1010, and
the Danes swarming hither in large numbers, it rose almost at
once to great importance, as appears from the Survey in the reign
of Edward the Confessor.&nbsp; This is highly probable if we
believe the best authority on the subject, namely the <i>Saxon
Chronicle</i>, which states that the city rose from desolation,
in 50 years, to be a place of great magnitude, far exceeding its
former size.&nbsp; The Danes came hither in such numbers that
they became the parent stock of the people of Norwich and
Norfolk; and this is proved by the names of many places in
Norfolk.</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Edward the Confessor began his reign in 1041, and the
Earldom of Norfolk was given to Harold, son of Earl Godwin, who
was afterwards king of England, and on his rebellion was seized
by the king and given to Algar, son of Leofric, Earl of Chester,
who resigned it again to Harold at his return; and in 1052, on
the death of Earl Godwin, Harold, in recompense for his
generosity, gave Algar his earldom again; but he being banished
in 1055, it came to the king, who pardoned him at Harold&rsquo;s
request, so that he enjoyed it till his death, when it came again
to the king.</p>
<h3><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
Norwich in the Norman Period.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Norman Conquest of England
caused many changes in Norfolk and Norwich.&nbsp; One of the
immediate results of the invasion, in 1066, was a vast influx of
foreigners into the county and city; and the pressure of the
Norman yoke was felt as much in Norwich as in any part of the
kingdom.&nbsp; It was about the same period that Jews began to
settle here for the first time, enriched by the extortions
incident to a conquest, and, as Fuller says, &ldquo;buying such
oppressed Englishmen&rsquo;s goods as Christians did not care to
meddle with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William the Conqueror caused a survey to be made of all the
lands in the country, the register of which is called the <span
class="smcap">Domesday Book</span>, and was finished in
1081.&nbsp; It is written in Roman with a mixture of Saxon, and
is still preserved in the chapter-house at Westminster, amongst
the national archives.&nbsp; It was printed in the 40th of George
III. for the use of the members of both houses of parliament, and
the public libraries of the kingdom.&nbsp; It specifies the
extent of the land in each district; the state it was in, whether
<a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>meadow,
pasture, wood, or arable; the name of the proprietor; the value,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Domesday Book, p. 13, states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Norwic, in the time of King Edward, were
1320 burgesses, of whom one was so much the king&rsquo;s vassal,
that he might not depart or do homage (to any other) without his
licence.&nbsp; His name was Edstan; he possessed 18 acres of land
and 12 of meadow, and two churches in the burgh and a sixth part
of a third, and to one of these churches there belonged one
mansion in the burgh and six acres of meadow: these six acres
Roger Bigod holds by the king&rsquo;s gift.&nbsp; And of 1238 (of
the said burgesses) the king and the earl had soc, sac, and
custom; and of 50 Stigand had the soc, sac, and patronage; and of
32 Harold had the soc, sac, and patronage,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
&amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soc, sac, and custom was the entire jurisdiction, for
<i>soc</i> is the power that any man had to hold courts, wherein
all that dwell on his land, or in his jurisdiction are answerable
to do suit and service; <i>sac</i> is the right of having all the
amerciaments and forfeitures of such suitors; and <i>custom</i>
includes all other profits.&nbsp; At this time, also, there were
no fewer than 136 burgesses who were Frenchmen, and only six who
were English in the new burgh, which comprised the parishes of
St. Giles&rsquo; and St. Peter&rsquo;s Mancroft.&nbsp; The Dutch
and the Flemings, about this time, came over the sea and located
themselves in the city and county, and introduced the worsted and
other manufactures.</p>
<p>William I. gave the Earldom of the city of Norwich to Ralph de
Guader, who designed to wed the daughter of one William
Fitz-Osbern, sister of <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Roger Earl of Hereford, and a
relative of the king.&nbsp; This matrimonial scheme not pleasing
the king, it was prohibited, but barons in those days would
sometimes have a will of their own, and the fair affianced was
made a bride within the castle walls, whose doorway in an angle
marks the site of the act of disobedience to the sovereign.&nbsp;
After the sumptuous feast, with its attendant libations, a
rebellion was planned by Waltheof, Earl of Northumberland,
Huntingdon, and Northampton, and Roger, Earl of Hereford.&nbsp;
Having carried the forbidden marriage into effect, they became
bold in their language and designs, until a chorus of excited
voices joined them in oaths as conspirators against their lord
the king.&nbsp; Treachery revealed the plot, and the church lent
its aid to the crown to crush the rebels.&nbsp; Lanfranc, then
the primate and archbishop, sent out troops, headed by bishops
and justiciaries, the highest dignitaries of church and law, to
oppose and besiege them.&nbsp; The bridegroom fled for succour to
his native Brittany, leaving his bride for three months to defend
the garrison with her retainers, at the end of which time the
brave Emma was forced to capitulate, but upon mild terms,
obtaining leave for herself and her followers to flee to
Brittany.&nbsp; Her husband became an outlaw, her brother was
slain, and scarcely one guest present at that ill-fated marriage
feast escaped an untimely end.</p>
<p>Nor did the city go unscathed.&nbsp; The devastation carried
into its midst was heavy; many houses were burnt, many were
deserted by those who had joined the earl, and it is curious to
read in the valuation of <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>land and property, taken soon after
this event, how many houses are recorded as void, both in the
burgh or that part of the city under the jurisdiction of the king
and earl, and in other portions, subject to other lords; for it
would seem that the landlords of the soil on which the city stood
were the king or earl of the castle, the bishop, and the Harold
family.&nbsp; Clusters of huts were then built round the base of
the hill, and constituted the feudal village; its inhabitants
consisting of villains, of which there were two classes, the
husbandmen or peasants annexed to the manor or land, and a lower
rank described as villains in gross, or absolute slaves,
transferable by deed from one owner to another, the lives of
these slaves being a continual state of toil, degradation and
suffering.</p>
<p>After the banishment of Earl Ralph, the king, having obtained
possession of the castle, appointed Roger Bigod constable, with a
limited power as bailiff, he having to collect the rents and
revenues belonging to the crown.&nbsp; He retained these honours
during the reign of the succeeding monarch, William Rufus, though
he joined in the fruitless attempt to place that king&rsquo;s
elder brother, Robert Curthose, on the throne.&nbsp; These
troubles were not ended till 1091, when the king made peace with
his brother Robert, agreeing that the lands of those who had
assisted him should be restored to them.</p>
<h3><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
Norwich in the Twelfth Century.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the commencement of this
century, a considerable addition was made to the population of
the city by a vast influx of Jews, who originally came from
Normandy, and were allowed to settle in England as chapmen for
the sale of confiscated goods.&nbsp; They afterwards became
numerous, and were so much in favour with William Rufus that he
is said to have sworn, by St. Luke&rsquo;s face, his usual oath,
that &ldquo;If the Jews should overcome the Christians, he
himself would become of their sect.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his reign the
present castle is supposed to have been built.</p>
<p>Henry I., on his accession to the crown, met with great
opposition from many of the nobles who were in the interest of
his elder brother, Robert, Duke of Normandy; but Roger Bigod
strongly espousing his cause, became a great favourite.&nbsp; In
the first part of his reign, the king gave him Framlingham in
Suffolk, and continued him Constable of the Castle till his
death.&nbsp; He was succeeded by his son William Bigod, on whose
decease Hugh Bigod, his brother, who inherited his estate, was
appointed Governor of the Castle.&nbsp; In 1122, the king kept
his Christmas in <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>Norwich, when, being pleased with the reception he met
with, he severed the government of the city from that of the
castle, the constable of which had been heretofore the sole
governor.&nbsp; Henry I. granted the city a charter containing
the same franchises as the city of London then enjoyed, and the
government of the city was then separated from that of the
castle, the chief officer being styled Propositus or
Provost.&nbsp; The liberties of the city from the time of Henry
I. to Edward III., were often suspended and gradually
enlarged.&nbsp; In 1403 the city was separated entirely from the
county of Norfolk, under the name of the county and city of
Norwich; and the first Mayor was then elected by the
citizens.&nbsp; The old corporation generally comprised a
dignified body of men, who maintained the hospitalities of the
city.&nbsp; Under the ancient charter the corporation of Norwich
consisted of a mayor, recorder, steward, two sheriffs,
twenty-four aldermen, including the mayor, and sixty common
councilmen.&nbsp; The Municipal Reform Act transferred its
government into the hands of a mayor, a sheriff, and a town
council consisting of forty-eight councillors, and sixteen
aldermen elected by the council, who unitedly elect the mayor and
sheriff.&nbsp; To these, and to a recorder, with an indefinite
number of magistrates appointed by the crown, the government of
the city is entrusted.</p>
<p>King Stephen, on his accession, granted the custody of the
castle to his favourite, Hugh Bigod, who was a principal
instrument in advancing him to the crown, by coming directly from
Normandy where Henry I. <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>died, and averring that he on his
deathbed had disinherited his daughter Maud, the empress, and
appointed Stephen, Earl of Bolyne, his heir.&nbsp; The citizens,
therefore, taking this opportunity, used what interest they could
with the king to obtain a new charter, vesting the government of
the city in coroners and bailiffs instead of provosts; but the
affair took a different turn to what they expected, for the king,
upon a distrust of Bigod favouring the cause of the Empress Maud,
seized the castle and all the liberties of the city into his own
hands, and soon afterwards granted to his natural son William,
for an appanage or increase of inheritance, the town and burgh of
the city of Norwich, in which were 1238 burgesses who held of the
king in burgage tenure; and also the castle and burgh thereof, in
which were 123 burgesses that held of the king in burgage, and
also the royal revenue of the whole county of Norfolk, excepting
what belonged to the bishopric, &amp;c.&nbsp; The whole rent of
the city, including the fee farm, was then about &pound;700 per
annum.&nbsp; The king restored the city liberties for a fine in
1139.</p>
<p>During the reign of King Stephen more Flemings came over; and
these successive immigrations were a real blessing to the
land.&nbsp; England had not been a manufacturing country at all
till the arrival of the Flemings, who introduced the preparation
and weaving of wool, so that, in process of time, not only the
home market was abundantly supplied with woollen cloth, but a
large surplus was made for exportation.&nbsp; The Flemings were
kinsmen of the Anglo-Saxon race, and <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>were distinguished for that probity
in their commercial dealings which afterwards became the
characteristic of the English merchants at large.</p>
<p>Henry II., in the first year of his reign, 1155, took the
city, castle, and liberties from William, the natural son of
Stephen; but, as a recompense, restored to him all those lands
which his father held in the reign of Henry I.&nbsp; He also
prevailed upon Hugh Bigod to yield up all his castles, whereby
the whole right became vested in the crown; the king governing
the city by the sheriff, who paid the profits arising therefrom
into the exchequer.&nbsp; About the year 1163 Hugh Bigod was
restored to the title of the Earl of Norfolk, and at the same
time appointed Constable of Norwich Castle, by which means he
became sole governor of the city.&nbsp; In 1182, the citizens
recovered the liberties of the city on paying a fine of 80 marks
to the king.</p>
<p>Richard I. was crowned September 4th, 1189, and a riot
happened on account of a Jew attempting to enter Westminster Hall
contrary to the king&rsquo;s express command.&nbsp; Many of the
Jews were killed, and their houses plundered and burnt.&nbsp; A
rumour was thereupon spread throughout the nation that the king
did not favour them, on which the people of Bury, Lynn, and
Norwich, took occasion to rise and rob great numbers of
them.&nbsp; On November 27th following, Roger, son of Hugh Bigod,
was created Earl of Norfolk, and steward of the king&rsquo;s
household.&nbsp; By his means the city regained as ample a
charter as London then possessed, for in 1193, the king granted
the city in fee farm to the citizens and their heirs, for a fee
farm rent of &pound;180 yearly.</p>
<h3><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Norwich in the Thirteenth Century.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">King John</span> ascended the throne in
1193, and in a few years afterwards the barons rebelled against
him.&nbsp; In 1215, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, joined the
insurgent barons.&nbsp; The king seized the castle, expelled the
earl, and appointed the Earl of Pembroke and John Fitz-Herbert
Constables of the Castle.&nbsp; Lewis, the Dauphin of France,
having obtained a grant of the kingdom from the pope, brought
over a large force, ravaged the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk,
took the castle, and reduced the city.&nbsp; He made William de
Bellomonte his marshal and constable, and placed him with a
garrison within the castle walls.</p>
<p>King John granted two charters to the citizens, bestowing
certain privileges; and he came to the city in 1256, as is
evident from the Charter of Liberties granted to the port of
Yarmouth, it being dated March 25, 1256, by the king at
Norwich.&nbsp; On the same day he likewise granted his third
Charter to the city, bestowing certain commercial
privileges.&nbsp; In 1265 Simon Montfort and his adherents seized
all the king&rsquo;s castles and committed the custody of them to
<a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>their
own friends, and having also gotten the king&rsquo;s person into
their power, they obliged him to send letters to the sheriffs of
counties, including Norfolk, commanding them to oppose all
attempts in favour of the king.&nbsp; But the king having routed
the barons at Eversham, removed all the constables which the
confederates had appointed, and amongst the rest Roger Bigod; in
whose stead, John de Vallibus, or Vaux, was made Constable of
this Castle, and Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and soon
afterwards, in consequence of great disturbances in the city, he
was ordered to enter it, and did so, notwithstanding its
liberties.&nbsp; In December, 1266, the displaced barons, headed
by Sir John de Evile, entered the city and killed many persons,
imprisoned more, plundered the town, and carried away the
wealthiest of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>According to Blomefield, about this time, on a Good Friday,
the Jews were accused of having crucified a boy, twelve years of
age, named William; and the date of his alleged death, March
24th, was marked as a holiday.&nbsp; No evidence is adduced that
the crime was committed, and no motive is assigned for it.&nbsp;
The date of the year is not given, and the boy&rsquo;s name
besides William is not stated.&nbsp; The Jews denied the charge,
but it was generally believed, and they were terribly
persecuted.&nbsp; The people then seized upon every pretence for
robbing and plundering the poor Jews.&nbsp; It is said that the
crime was discovered by Erlward, a burgess, as they were going to
bury the body in Thorpe Wood.&nbsp; On this the Jews applied to
<a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>the
sheriff, and promised him 100 marks if he would free them from
this charge.&nbsp; The sheriff sending for Erlward obliged him to
swear that so long as he lived he would never accuse the Jews nor
discover the fact.&nbsp; About five years afterwards, Erlward, on
his deathbed, made known the whole affair, and the body, it is
said, having been found in the wood, was taken and buried in the
churchyard of the monks.&nbsp; They alleged that many miracles
were there wrought by it which occasioned its being removed into
the church and enshrined in the year 1150.</p>
<p>Edward I. succeeded to the throne in 1272, and in the next
year the king appointed Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, to be
Constable of the Castle.&nbsp; The interdict, which was removed
on Christmas eve, was renewed on the day after Epiphany, but was
taken off till Easter, when it was renewed the third time.&nbsp;
In 1274, the affair between the monks and citizens continuing
unsettled, it was referred to the pope, who left it to the
decision of the king, who adjudged the citizens to pay 500 marks
yearly for six years, and to give the church a cup of the value
of &pound;100, and weighing 10 lbs. in gold.&nbsp; The monks were
to repair their gates and to have access to all parts of the
city, and some of the chief citizens were to go to Rome to beg
the pope&rsquo;s pardon.&nbsp; These conditions being agreed to,
the king restored to the city all its ancient privileges on
payment of a fine of 40s. yearly, besides the old fee farm.&nbsp;
The interdict was also removed on November 1st, 1275.&nbsp; The
king kept his Easter in the city in 1277, and he granted a new
charter in 1285.&nbsp; <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>In 1289 the liberties were seized,
but were restored again at the end of the year.&nbsp; Soon
afterwards the king, while on a pilgrimage to Walsingham, granted
a new charter.&nbsp; In 1296, the city first sent representatives
to parliament, originally four in number, who were paid for their
services, but on account of the expense the number was reduced to
two members.</p>

Norwich in the Fourteenth Century.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this century this city and other
towns began to obtain political privileges.&nbsp; The kings of
the middle ages found themselves obliged to summon burgesses to
parliament in order to obtain supplies.&nbsp; The early
parliaments appear to have been convened chiefly for this
purpose, and were constantly dissolved as soon as the business
for which they met was transacted.&nbsp; Formerly the burgesses
returned were always citizens, who really were representatives of
the city and its interests, and not merely supporters of the
ministry of the day.&nbsp; There is no record of the early local
elections, but lists will be given of the burgesses returned.</p>
<p>Edward II. began his reign on July 7th, 1307, and he reigned
nineteen years.&nbsp; Walter de Norwich, son of Jeffry de
Norwich, was so much in favour with the king as to be one of the
Barons of the Exchequer in 1311, and in 1314 was summoned as a
parliamentary baron, and afterwards made the Treasurer of the
Exchequer, which office he held several years.&nbsp; He obtained
liberty for free warren in all his demean lands, and a fair to
the manor of Ling in Norfolk, on <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>July 20th, and two days
following.&nbsp; He continued in favour till his death.</p>
<p>In the reign of Edward III., <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1328, the king, by a statute, made
Norwich a staple town for the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, by
which the trade of the city was much increased.&nbsp; In the
&ldquo;Paston Letters&rdquo; we find the following reference to
articles of Norfolk manufacture:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I pray that you will send me hither two
ells of worsted for doublets, to happen me this cold winter, and
that ye enquire where William Paston bought his tippet of fine
worsted which is almost like silk, and if that be much finer that
ye sh&rsquo;d buy me, after seven or eight shillings, then buy me
a quarter and the nail thereof for collars, though it be dearer
than the other, for I would make my doublet all worsted for the
honour of Norfolk.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1340, Norwich Castle was made the public prison for the
county of Norfolk, and the custody thereof was committed to the
sheriff.&nbsp; A great tournament was held in Norwich, at which
the king, with his queen Phillippa, was present; and they kept
their court at the bishop&rsquo;s palace.&nbsp; In 1342 the king
and queen honoured the city with another visit.</p>
<p>In 1344 a new charter was granted, by which the liberty of the
castle was reduced to the outward limits of the present ditch,
and so continues.&nbsp; By this charter, the citizens became
proprietor&rsquo;s of the ancient fee of the castle, that is, the
castle ditches, and the great croft, now the market place.</p>
<p>In the reign of Richard II., <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1381, Wat Tyler&rsquo;s rebellion
broke out in London.&nbsp; Insurrection became <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>prevalent
in many parts of the kingdom, manufactures declined, and
discontent became general.&nbsp; Norwich and Norfolk shared in
the general plunder at the hands of armed bands.&nbsp; Under John
Lyster, Litister, or Linster, a dyer, 50,000 men attacked the
city and committed great depredations.&nbsp; They were, however,
pursued to North Walsham by the king&rsquo;s troops under the
command of Henry Le Spencer, Bishop of Norwich, and
defeated.&nbsp; Their leader and many of his adherents were taken
and executed for high treason.&nbsp; They were hung, drawn, and
quartered, according to the barbarous usage of the times.&nbsp;
In 1399, the bailiffs having put the city into a proper posture
of defence, openly declared for Henry Duke of Lancaster, son and
heir of John of Gaunt, the late deceased duke, their especial
friend.&nbsp; On this declaration, Henry gave them strong
assurances that, whenever it was in his power, the charter which
they so earnestly desired for electing a mayor, &amp;c., should
be granted them, and he was afterwards as good as his word.&nbsp;
The great connection there was between John of Gaunt and this
city, arose through William Norwich, a knight, who was a friend
of the Duke&rsquo;s, and who frequently visited the town, for
which he always expressed great regard.&nbsp; In 1389, the great
John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, visited this city, and was
honourably received.</p>
<p>In the first year of Henry IV., Sir Thomas Erpingham, knight,
a Norfolk man, Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Lord Chamberlain,
obtained the King&rsquo;s Charter, dated at Westminster, February
6th, 1399, <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>confirming all the former charters ever granted to the
city.&nbsp; In 1409, through the interest of Sir Thomas, a grant
was made to the city for a certain term of years of the alnage
and survey of all manner of worsteds made in Norwich and
Norfolk.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. George&rsquo;s Company</span> took its
rise in the second half of the fourteenth century, and consisted
of a society of brethren and sisters associated in honour of the
Martyr St. George, who by voluntary contributions supported a
chaplain to celebrate service every day in the cathedral before
the altar, for the welfare of the brethren and sisters of the
Guild, whilst living, and of their souls when dead.&nbsp; In this
state they continued till the fourth year of Henry V., when that
prince granted them a charter dated at Reading, incorporating
them by the name of the Aldermen, Masters, Brethren, and Sisters
of the Fraternity and Guild of St. George in Norwich; and
empowering them to choose yearly, one Alderman and two Masters,
and to make all reasonable orders and constitutions for their own
government; to have a common seal; to sue and be sued; and to
maintain a chaplain to pray daily for the health of the king, the
alderman, masters, and sisters whilst alive, and their souls when
dead; and lastly to purchase &pound;10 per annum in
mortmain.&nbsp; The prior, mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen of the
Guild, had power to expel or remove any member for bad
behaviour.&nbsp; In consequence of this charter, ordinances were
made for the well-governing of the society, and for yearly
choosing one alderman, four masters, and <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>twenty-four
brethren, for the Assembly or Common Council.&nbsp; In 1451, by
the mediation of Judge Yelverton, the disputes between the Guild
and the city were settled; when it was agreed that the mayor for
the time being should yearly, on the day after the Guild, be
chosen Alderman of the Guild for the year following his
mayoralty, that the Assembly of the Guild should consist of
twenty persons, and that the common council of the city should be
eligible for admission into the company, but be liable to the
charge of the feast.&nbsp; Indeed, the chief object of the Guild
was feasting.&nbsp; Every brother took an oath on
admission.&nbsp; The Aldermen and Common Council of the Guild had
power to choose such men and women, inhabitants of the city, to
be brethren and sisters of the Guild, as they might think
fit.&nbsp; But no man living out of the city could be chosen
unless he was a knight, esquire, or gentleman of note.&nbsp; Many
other orders were made in regard to their procession, which was
always very grand.&nbsp; This Guild, with the other ancient
crafts or companies of the city, made a very splendid appearance
on all public occasions.&nbsp; The companies were then on the
same footing as those of the city of London now are, and some of
the trades long continued as a fraternity, and chose wardens
among themselves.&nbsp; From the Friday after May day, to the
Friday before the Guild day, the members of St. George&rsquo;s
Company used to meet every evening at the Guildhall in the Market
Place, where they refreshed themselves with as much sack and
sugar rolls as they pleased, besides two penny cakes from the
baker&rsquo;s.&nbsp; <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Being thus assembled they sent for
the last chosen feast-makers, and asked them whether they
intended to bear the charges of the feast, &ldquo;which&rdquo;
(said they) &ldquo;will cost you more than you
think.&rdquo;&nbsp; By this they so terrified timorous, wary
people, that they were persuaded to buy it off, though, had they
agreed to make the feast, it would not have cost them much more
than &pound;6 or &pound;7, which sum they were glad to
save.&nbsp; The Company continued till February 24th, 1731, when
the committee appointed for the purpose reported to an assembly
held that day, that they had treated with St. George&rsquo;s
Company, who had agreed to deliver up their charters, books, and
records, into the hands of the corporation, provided the latter
would pay their debts, amounting to &pound;236 15s. 1d., which,
being agreed to, they were accordingly delivered up and deposited
with the city records in the Guildhall.&nbsp; Thus terminated
this ancient feasting company by the surrender of all their goods
to the corporation.</p>
<h3><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>CHAPTER X.<br />
Norwich in the Fifteenth Century.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the commencement of this century
(in 1402) the grand affair of obtaining a new charter occupied
the greater part of the time of the citizens, but as nothing
could be done without the concurrence of Bishop Spencer, they at
last found means to soften him, and to obtain his promise that he
would not oppose them in this their favourite object.&nbsp; All
obstacles being now removed, they offered to lend Henry 1000
marks, which so far obliged the king that he was willing to give
them as full a charter as they could desire.&nbsp; This was
accordingly done, and the new charter was granted on January
28th, 1403.&nbsp; By this charter the city obtained a full power
of local self-government.</p>
<p>Henry V. began his reign on March 20th, 1412, in which year
the city was in great disorder, occasioned by the disputes
between the Mayor and the Commons, respecting the election of
mayors, sheriffs, and other officers of the corporation, and the
powers granted by the charter, concerning which they could not
agree.&nbsp; These contentions exhausted the <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>city
treasury, and at length they were settled by the mediation of Sir
Robert Berney, John Lancaster, William Paston, and others.&nbsp;
The burgesses who served in Parliament in this reign were R.
Brasier, R. Dunston, W. Sedman, J. Biskelee, H. Rufman, W. Eton,
J. Alderfold, W. Appleyard, R. Baxter, and Henry Peking.</p>
<p>In 1422 the doctrines of the Reformation were introduced into
the city, and several persons were executed as Wickliffites or
Lollards.&nbsp; A large chalk pit, in Thorpe Hamlet, on the
outskirts of the city, is to this day called
&ldquo;Lollards&rsquo; Pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry VI., when only nine months old, was proclaimed king on
August 31st, 1422, and in his reign a general persecution of the
Lollards broke out in this diocese.&nbsp; The Lollards were men
who earnestly desired the reformation of the church, and they
were followers of that great and good man John Wickliffe, but
they were called Lollards as a name of infamy.&nbsp; They were so
zealous for the truth that they chose rather to suffer grievous
torments and death than forsake their faith.&nbsp; On this
account about 120 persons were persecuted for their profession of
the pure gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>On June 6th, 1448, the king paid a royal visit to the city,
and among other preparations the gates were decorated, and the
King&rsquo;s arms, and the arms of St. George, were painted and
raised on six of the gates.&nbsp; In 1449, his Majesty paid
another visit, after a sojourn with the Earl of Suffolk at
Costessey.&nbsp; The king entered Norwich by St. Benedict&rsquo;s
Gate, which was <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>especially ornamented for the occasion.&nbsp; These
peaceable entries, with the picturesque pomp of a royal
procession, always pleased the loyal citizens.</p>
<p>In 1452, it being rumoured that Edward earl of March, son to
the duke of York, was advancing towards London, the queen, much
terrified thereat, tried to make as many friends as she could,
and for that purpose came to this city, when, in full assembly,
the Commons resolved to advance 100 marks as a loan to the king;
and the aldermen at the same time presented the queen with 60
marks, to which the Commons added 40 more, so that the king had
now 200 marks of the city.&nbsp; The citizens then obtained a new
charter, dated March 17th, and consented to in full
parliament.&nbsp; It contained a restitution of all liberties, a
general pardon of all past offences, and a confirmation of all
former charters.</p>
<p>In 1460, during the contest between the houses of York and
Lancaster, the mayor and aldermen raised forty armed men and the
Commons eighty, and appointed Wm. Rookwood, Esq., their captain,
with whom they agreed for six weeks&rsquo; pay, at six-pence a
day for each soldier, and sent them to the assistance of the
king, who wrote them a letter of thanks, with a request that they
would maintain the soldiers for one month longer, which was
readily complied with.&nbsp; In 1474, the king visited the city,
and was presented with a sum of money by way of benevolence; but
in the following year the city had to pay &pound;80 6s. 11d. for
the forces employed in France.</p>
<p>In July 1469, Elizabeth Woodville, the queen of <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Edward IV.,
visited Norwich and remained here several days.&nbsp; Her
majesty, with a great retinue, entered the city through
&ldquo;Westwyk Gate,&rdquo; which was decorated for the
occasion.&nbsp; John Parnell was brought from Ipswich to exercise
his skill in ornamentation; and under his superintendence, a
stage covered with red-and-green worsted was erected, adorned
with figures of angels, escutcheons, and banners of the royal
lady and the king, with a profusion of crowns, roses,
fleur-de-lys, &amp;c.&nbsp; Gilbert Spurling exhibited a fragment
of the salutation of Mary and Elizabeth, which required from him
a speech in explanation.</p>
<p>In 1486, being the 1st Henry VII., on the rebellion of Lambert
Simnel, who assumed the name of Edward Plantagenet, the king,
expecting an invasion of the eastern parts of his kingdom, made a
progress through Norfolk and Suffolk to confirm the inhabitants
in their loyalty, and spent his Christmas at Norwich, when the
city made him a handsome present.&nbsp; Hence he went a
pilgrimage to Walsingham, so famous for its pretended miracles,
where he made his vows; and after he returned victorious, he sent
his banner to be offered there as an acknowledgment of his
prayers having been heard.</p>
<p>The monastic institutions of this city might claim the honour
of having some learned men connected with them in the 15th
century.&nbsp; Thomas Brinton, or Brampton, a monk of Norwich,
attained to such an eminence in the schools of England that his
fame was spread abroad, and he was sent for by the pope to
Rome.&nbsp; He often preached before the pope in Latin, <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>and being
first made his penitentiary was afterwards raised to the see of
Rochester.&nbsp; His sermons preached before the pope were
published, with some others.&nbsp; John Stow, who flourished in
1440, was a Benedictine monk of the monastery of St. Saviour, in
Norwich, and doctor of divinity of Oxford.&nbsp; It appears, by
his works, that he was at the council of Basil.&nbsp; His works
were <i>The Acts of the Council</i> at Basil; various
<i>Collections</i>; and <i>Solemn Disputations</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp;
John Mear, a monk of Norwich, and D.D. of Oxford, was a person of
subtle art for explaining difficulties.&nbsp; He was divinity
reader at several monasteries, and the author of several works,
which have all been lost.</p>
<h3><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>CHAPTER XI.<br />
Norwich in the Sixteenth Century.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the commencement of this century
most of the houses in the city were built of wood with thatched
roofs.&nbsp; This accounts for the number of fires which broke
out at different times, and which, in 1507 and 1509, reduced a
large portion of the city to ashes, no fewer than 718 houses
being consumed in the latter year.&nbsp; These conflagrations
induced the corporation, in 1509, to issue an order that no
newly-erected buildings in the city should be covered with
thatch, but this injunction not extending to those previously
erected, some few still retain this dangerous covering.</p>
<p>In 1501, John Rightwise, then mayor, began building the cross
in the Market Place, and finished it in 1503.&nbsp; It was a
commodious and handsome pile, but falling into decay, it was sold
by the Tonnage Committee in 1732 for &pound;125, and soon
afterwards it was taken down.&nbsp; About 1506, St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Church was built, near the site of the old church
of St. Christopher.</p>
<p>Henry VIII. began his reign on April 22nd, 1509, when the city
was in a state of great distraction, on <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>account of
the terrible fires which caused much destruction of
property.&nbsp; In that year a great part of the cathedral, with
its vestry, and all the ornaments and books were destroyed by a
fire, which broke out on St. Thomas&rsquo; night.&nbsp; In 1515,
the Lady Mary, sister to the king, and her consort the Duke of
Suffolk, visited the city on their return from France, and were
nobly entertained.&nbsp; Henry VIII., while he continued a
papist, burned the reformers; and when in a fit of anger he
disowned the pope and assumed the English tiara, he was no less
zealous against both Papist and Puritan, who would not bind their
consciences to his royal decrees.&nbsp; During the prelacy of
Richard Nykke or Nix, the bigotted bishop of Norwich, several
church reformers were burnt here and at other places.</p>
<p>In 1517, Cardinal Wolsey visited the city to mediate between
the citizens and the monks, but their disputes were not finally
settled till 1524, when the jurisdiction of the convent was
ascertained and separated from that of the corporation until
1538, when they were converted into a dean and chapter.</p>
<p>On March 2nd, 1520, Queen Catherine and Cardinal Wolsey
visited the city, and all the city companies went to meet the
queen &ldquo;in Puke and Dirke Tawney Liveries,&rdquo; and the
city presented her with 100 marks.</p>
<p>In 1522, in consequence of the many vexatious suits in the
Sheriff&rsquo;s Court for words and trifling debts, it was agreed
that four aldermen be named, one out of each of the great wards,
to sit in person, or by deputies, every Wednesday, from eight
till nine in the morning, <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>to adjust all debts under two
shillings, and all actions on words, for the ease and peace of
the city.&nbsp; This institution was of great benefit, and in
some measure answered the purpose of the old Court of
Conscience.</p>
<p>In 1524, on September 2nd, through the mediation of Cardinal
Wolsey, a composition and final agreement was sealed between the
prior and the city at the Guildhall, by which the city resigned
all jurisdiction within the walls of the priory, the whole site
thereof being hereby acknowledged to be part of the County of
Norfolk and in the Hundred of Blofield; and the church gave up
all right of jurisdiction in every place without their walls and
within the walls of the city; so that now, Tombland, with the
fairs kept thereon, and all things belonging to those
fairs&mdash;and Holmstrete, Spytelond, and Ratten Row, with their
letes&mdash;were adjudged to belong to the city, and to be part
of the county thereof.&nbsp; The prior and convent and their
successors were also exempted from all tolls, customs, and
exactions whatever, by land or water in the whole city, or county
of the city and its liberties, for goods or chattels bought or
sold for the use of the prior and convent, their households, or
families.</p>
<p>In 1525 the king granted the city another charter, confirmed
likewise by parliament, in which the late composition and
agreement between the city and prior was fully recited and
established, and new privileges were granted.</p>
<p>In 1530 the king was declared supreme head of the church of
England; and was acknowledged so by act of parliament in
1535.&nbsp; In the latter year an act was <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>passed for
recontinuing liberties in the crown, by which all cities,
boroughs, and towns corporate, had their liberties and privileges
fully confirmed.</p>
<h4>BILNEY&rsquo;S MARTYRDOM.</h4>
<p>A short account of the martyrdom of Thomas Bilney, in 1531,
may serve to illustrate the persecuting spirit of the age.&nbsp;
He had renounced the tenets of the Church of Rome, and was
condemned on the following passages extracted from two sermons
which he had preached in 1527, at Ipswich.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our Saviour Christ is our Mediator between
us and the Father; what need have we therefore for any remedy
from saints?&nbsp; It is a great injury to the blood of Christ to
make such petitions, and blasphemeth our Saviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man is so imperfect by himself, that he can in no wise
merit by his own deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coming of Christ was long prophesied before, and
desired by the prophets; but John Baptist, being more than a
prophet, did not only prophesy, but with his finger shewed Him,
saying, &lsquo;<i>Behold the Lamb of God</i>, <i>which taketh
away the sins of the world</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, if this was
the very Lamb which John did demonstrate, that taketh away the
sins of the world, what injury is it to our Saviour Christ, that
to be buried in St. Francis&rsquo; cowl should remit four parts
of penance?&nbsp; What is then left to our Saviour Christ, which
taketh away the sins of the world?&nbsp; This I will justify to
be a great blasphemy to the blood of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is great folly to go on pilgrimages; and preachers
in times past have been antichrists; and now it hath pleased God
somewhat to shew forth their falsehoods and errors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>&ldquo;The miracles done at Walsingham, Canterbury, and
Ipswich, were done by the devil through the sufferance of God, to
blind the poor people; and the Pope hath not the keys that St.
Peter had, except he followeth Peter in his living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christian people should set up no lights before images
of saints, for saints in heaven need no lights, and images have
no eyes to see; and, therefore, as Ezechias destroyed the brazen
serpent that Moses made by the commandment of God, even so should
the kings and princes of these times destroy and burn the images
of saints set up in churches.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was further deposed against Bilney, that he was notoriously
suspected to be a heretic, and that in his sermons he had
exhorted the people to put away their gods of silver and gold,
and to desist from offering to them either candle, wax, money, or
any other thing; and that in rehearsing the litany he said,
&ldquo;pray you only to God and no saints;&rdquo; and when he
came to that part, Sancta Maria, &amp;c., or, O Saint Mary pray
for us, he called out, &ldquo;stop there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These and many other articles of the like nature being proved,
he was exhorted to recant and abjure them; and upon his refusing
to do so, the Bishop of London, having pulled off his cap, and
made the sign of the cross on his forehead and breast, pronounced
the following sentence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I, by the counsel and consent of my
brethren here present, do pronounce thee, Thomas Bilney, who has
been accused of divers articles, to be convicted of heresy; and
for the rest of the sentence we will deliberate till
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>The
next day Bilney was again asked whether he would recant and
return to the unity of the church; when he desired a day or two
for consideration and to consult his friends.&nbsp; In fear of a
dreadful death at the expiration of the time, he subscribed his
abjuration; and being absolved, he had the following penance
enjoined him; to bear a faggot at the procession at St.
Paul&rsquo;s, bareheaded, and to stand before the preacher during
the sermon there, and to remain in prison till he should be
released by Cardinal Wolsey.&nbsp; When in prison, the reflection
on what he had done drove Bilney almost to despair, and he
suffered all the agonies of remorse for more than twelve
months.</p>
<p>At length he resolved to seal that truth which he had so
shamefully abjured, with his blood.&nbsp; For this purpose he
travelled to Norwich, and on his way to the city he openly
preached those doctrines for which he had been condemned; and
being apprehended, was confined in one of the cells under the
Guildhall.&nbsp; On August 19th, he was taken to Lollards&rsquo;
pit, outside of Bishopsgate, and burnt there in the presence of a
crowd of horrified spectators.</p>
<p>This and many other instances may serve to show the
persecuting spirit of a church which had arrogated to itself a
dominion over the consciences of men, and dared to propagate a
religion of fear as the religion of Christ.&nbsp; After the
Reformation, which had now begun, the same persecuting spirit was
manifested by the Church of England; and many suffered here for
their nonconformity to the Establishment.&nbsp; Several other
martyrs were burnt in Norwich during the same reign, <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>and in
1539, one William Leyton, a monk of Eye, in Suffolk, was burnt
here, for speaking against a certain idol which used to be
carried about in procession at Eye; and for asserting that the
sacrament ought to be administered in both kinds.</p>
<p>In the same year peace and amity were settled between the
church and the city on a much more stable foundation than had
been previously effected, by an arrangement as to jurisdictions
of the authorities.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1534 an act was passed for rebuilding those parts of the
city which were laid waste by the late fires; by which it was
enacted that if the owners of such void grounds should, by the
space of two years after proclamation made by the mayor for all
persons to rebuild or enclose their grounds, neglect to rebuild
on such ground, or sufficiently enclose the same with mortar and
stone, then it should be lawful for the mayor, etc., to enter on
such vacant grounds, and hold and retain them to their own use
and their successors&rsquo; use for ever, discharged of all rents
and outgoings whatsoever, provided that, within two years after
such entry made, they either rebuild or enclose them as
aforesaid.</p>
<h4>DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES.</h4>
<p>If, in giving an account of the state of society in the middle
ages, we were to omit from our enumeration of causes the vast
influence of the clergy of the church of Rome, we should present
a very imperfect view of the subject.&nbsp; The priests dominated
over the <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>minds of men for many centuries, and their influence
either for good or evil pervaded all classes of society.&nbsp;
This influence caused the erection of monasteries, nunneries,
priories, and friaries, nineteen in number, in Norwich before the
16th century.&nbsp; Monastic institutions were originally
beneficial to society.&nbsp; In the dark ages, they preserved
learning to some extent, and were houses of refuge for the
destitute.&nbsp; No doubt there were many good self-denying men
and women amongst the monks and nuns, who did some service to the
poor who then abounded in the land.&nbsp; But in time the
monasteries sunk for the most part into dissolute
confraternities; stupid and sleepy, where not vicious; and banded
together against the liberties of the nation; and there were
constant broils between the monks and the citizens in
Norwich.</p>
<p>The king having entirely renounced the authority of the church
of Rome, and assumed the title of Head of the Church of England,
caused a very strict inquiry to be instituted into the state of
all monastic institutions.&nbsp; This inquiry resulted in their
suppression, more for the gratification of the monarch&rsquo;s
avarice than from his desire to benefit his subjects; and most of
the monks in Norwich and Norfolk, as well as in other parts of
England, were sent adrift with small pensions.&nbsp; The king,
indeed&mdash;in revenge for being excommunicated by the
pope&mdash;suppressed 1148 monasteries in England, whose revenues
amounted to &pound;183,707 yearly.&nbsp; He either seized the
property for himself or divided it amongst his favourites, and
the Duke of Norfolk obtained a great part of it in Norwich.&nbsp;
The dissolution <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>of those ancient institutions caused a great deal of
poverty; the priests were driven out homeless over the land, and
the poor had no houses of refuge and no means of relief.</p>
<p>In 1538, Thomas Cromwell, lord privy seal, the king&rsquo;s
vicegerent, sent injunctions to all bishops and curates, charging
them to take care that an English bible of the largest size be
placed open in each parish church, for every one to have recourse
to.&nbsp; The open bible was generally read in this city and
elsewhere, and this, no doubt, promoted the reformation of
religion.&nbsp; In spite of the tyranny of kings, the domination
of priests, and the superstition of the people, the Reformation
still advanced, and the national mind was emancipated by degrees
from ancient thraldom.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1545, one Rogers, of Norfolk, was condemned and suffered
martyrdom, for opposing the six articles of an act passed for
abolishing diversity of opinions in religion.&nbsp; This act
inflicted the penalty of death upon those&mdash;1st, who by word
or writing denied transubstantiation; 2nd, who maintained that
communion in both kinds was necessary; 3rd, or asserted that it
was lawful for priests to marry; 4th, or that vows of chastity
might be broken; 5th, or that private masses are profitable; 6th,
or that auricular confession is not necessary to salvation.</p>
<p>The king died on the 28th January, 1546; and his exequies were
celebrated here with great pomp, as appears from the
chamberlain&rsquo;s account; though what good he ever did for the
city it would be hard to say.&nbsp; <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>He was a king who spared no man in
his anger and no woman in his lust.&nbsp; In his reign, 72,000
persons were hung for political offences or for the crime of
poverty as a warning to others.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Merry
England&rdquo; of those days was in fact a terrible country to
live in.&nbsp; Men were beaten, scourged, branded with hot irons,
and killed without mercy or limit.</p>
<p>Edward VI. was proclaimed king on January 28th, 1546; and on
February 25th, his coronation was celebrated with much pomp in
Norwich, where great rejoicings took place.&nbsp; Six large guns
were fired on Tombland; the populace were treated with plenty of
beer; and bonfires were lighted in several of the streets.&nbsp;
There was a grand procession with a pageant, in which the king
was represented by an effigy of king Solomon.</p>
<p>On March 8th, 1546, Edward VI., and the executors of his
deceased father, granted to the mayor, sheriffs, citizens, and
commonalty, the hospital of St. Giles&rsquo; in this city, now
called the Old Men&rsquo;s hospital, with all the revenues
belonging thereto for the maintenance of poor people dwelling
therein, all which the late king had promised to give them at the
request of the citizens, a short time before his death.</p>
<p>Norwich has always been noted for its civic feasts and good
cheer; and Bale, writing at this time (1549), in his
&ldquo;Continuation of Leland&rsquo;s Antiquities,&rdquo;
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, cytie of England, whose glory standeth
more in belly chere than in the searche of wisdome godlye, how
cometh it that neither you nor yet your ydell masmongers have
regarded this most worthy commodytie of your countrye?&nbsp; I
mean the conservacyon of your antiquyties, <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>and of the
worthy labours of your learned men.&nbsp; I thynke the renowne of
such a notable act would have much longer endured than of all
your belly banquettes and table triumphes, either yet of your
newly purchased hawles, to keep St. George&rsquo;s feast
in.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have been also at Norwyche, our second
cytie of name, and there all the library monuments are turned to
the use of their grossers, candelmakers, sope sellers,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Small credit is here given to the city for the patronage and
promotion of intellectual pursuits.</p>
<h4>KETT&rsquo;S REBELLION.</h4>
<p>In 1549 the city was the scene of an insurrection resembling
that of the Jacquerie in France, and the War of the Peasants in
Germany.&nbsp; The facts of this local rebellion were simple
enough.&nbsp; The poor people objected to the enclosure of waste
lands, in the neighbourhood of Attleborough and Wymondham, by the
nobility and gentry, who had been put in possession of the abbey
lands, which had been previously appropriated for the use of the
poor, who still considered that they had a right of commonage on
the waste lands and open pastures.&nbsp; The rebellion commenced
at Eccles, Wilby, Attleborough, and the neighbouring villages,
the inhabitants of which were enraged at Mr. John Green, lord of
the manor of Wilby, who had enclosed that part of the common
belonging to his manor, which had from time immemorial been open
to the adjoining commons of Hargham and Attleborough, <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>and in
which the people had enjoyed all rights of intercommoning with
each other.&nbsp; The people continued quiet till Wymondham fair,
on July 7th, when they collected in large numbers.&nbsp; The
leaders of the movement, accompanied by a large number of others,
went to Morley, about a mile from Wymondham, and laid open the
new enclosures; and on returning to Wymondham, they destroyed all
the fences by which the commons and wastes were enclosed.&nbsp;
John Flowerdew, of Hethersett, incensed at the destruction of his
fences, gave forty pence to a number of the country people to
throw down the fences of Robert Kett, alias Knight, whose pasture
lay near Wymondham Fairstead.&nbsp; They carried out his wishes
to the full, and on the following morning returned to Hethersett,
where, at Kett&rsquo;s instigation, they laid open other
enclosures of Flowerdew&rsquo;s.&nbsp; After this, the rioters
appointed Robert Kett and his brother William, a butcher, to be
their captains, and the movement soon assumed the form of an
organized rebellion.&nbsp; The numbers of the rebels quickly
increased, and marching on Mousehold Heath, they took possession
of the mansion of the Earl of Surrey; and thence proceeded to lay
siege to the city.&nbsp; They held courts of justice under a
large tree, called the &ldquo;Oak of Reformation:&rdquo; and
having augmented their numbers to 16,000 from the citizens, and
strongly fortified their camp, they summoned the city to
surrender.&nbsp; For months they maintained hostilities, and the
country round was pillaged and laid waste, until at length they
gained an entrance to the city, and took the <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>mayor and
several councillors prisoners to their camp.&nbsp; A strong force
was thereupon sent down for the defence of the city, under the
Marquis of Northampton, and a regular battle was fought at the
base of the hill on St. Martin&rsquo;s Palace Plain.&nbsp; In
this engagement Lord Sheffield was slain; and the rebels, having
forced the Marquis to retreat, plundered the city, and set fire
to it in many parts.&nbsp; In short, all attempts to quell this
violent insurrection were ineffectual, till a large army, which
had been raised to proceed against the Scots, was ordered to
march to the relief of Norwich, under the command of the Earl of
Warwick, who arrived under the city walls on the 23rd of
August.&nbsp; On the following day, after making an ineffectual
offer of pardon to the insurgents, on the condition that they
should lay down their arms, the king&rsquo;s troops commenced
their attack; and having made several breaches in the walls, and
forced open some of the gates, they soon entered the city, and
took possession of the Market Place.&nbsp; In the midst of this
scene of blood, the king&rsquo;s ammunition carriages, having
entered apart from the main body of the army, were captured by
the enemy, but were soon retaken by a detachment from the Market
Place.&nbsp; A large body of the rebels still remaining in the
city now made a lodgement on Tombland, and through their superior
local knowledge, greatly annoyed the soldiers by posting small
parties at the angles of the different streets leading to the
Market.&nbsp; The Earl of Warwick, however, brought out his whole
force to scour the city, and the rebels, after setting fire to
their camp, were <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>obliged to quit their post on the hill and retreat to
Dussyn&rsquo;s Dale, on Mousehold, resolving to finish the
business by a general engagement in the valley.</p>
<p>On August 27th, being re-enforced by a newly-arrived
detachment of troops, the Earl marched out of the city to attack
the rebels, to whom he again offered pardon, provided they would
quietly lay down their arms; but, confident in their numbers,
they refused to capitulate.&nbsp; A bloody conflict ensued, but
the rebels, being unaccustomed to the discharge of artillery,
were soon in confusion.&nbsp; Of this the Light Horse took
advantage, and advancing to the charge, drove the rebels from the
field and pursued them with great slaughter.&nbsp; Over 3000 were
killed, and about 300 of the ringleaders were afterwards
executed.&nbsp; The gates of the city suffered much damage during
this insurrection.&nbsp; The rebels set Bishop&rsquo;s gate on
fire, with some of the houses in the street, and those belonging
to the Great Hospital.&nbsp; Pockthorpe, Magdalen, St. Augustine,
Coslany, and Ber Street gates, shared the same fate.&nbsp; When
the disturbances ceased, the repair of the city generally was
commenced, and especially of the gates.&nbsp; Outside Magdalen
Gates a gallows was erected, at which place and at the cross in
the Market Place 300 rebels were executed.&nbsp; Two, styled
prophets, were hanged, drawn, and quartered, their heads being
placed on the towers, and their quarters on the gates.</p>
<p>Robert and William Kett were tried in London for high treason
and rebellion, and convicted.&nbsp; On November 29th, they were
delivered to Sir Edmund Windham, High Sheriff of the counties of
Norfolk and Suffolk, to <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>receive punishment.&nbsp; Robert was
conveyed to Norwich, and being brought to the foot of the castle,
was drawn up to a gibbet erected at the top, and there left
hanging alive till he died by famine; and his body, being
entirely wasted, at length fell down.&nbsp; A similar sentence
was executed upon William, who was suspended alive upon the top
of Wymondham steeple.&nbsp; This fearful rebellion having been
thus brought to an end, the citizens, after the departure of the
kings troops, began to repair the damages to the walls and
gates.&nbsp; Unhappily, however, their trials were not yet over,
for the late disastrous occurrences were followed by such a
scarcity and dearness of provisions, that the corporation issued
an edict, requiring all the wealthier inhabitants to find corn
for their own households elsewhere, so that their poorer
neighbours might have the exclusive benefit of the city
markets.</p>
<h4>QUEEN MARY.</h4>
<p>The Princess Mary was proclaimed here on July 18th, 1553, and
was the first English Queen in her own right, and the people of
Norwich and Norfolk rushed to her standard, impelled by the
memory of Kett&rsquo;s rebellion.&nbsp; The queen was a bigoted
Roman Catholic, and in her reign popery was revived in its worst
form, associated with all the atrocities of the most sanguinary
persecution.&nbsp; Protestants were gathered like fuel for
burning; and as for the Puritans, no fate could be too severe for
them.</p>
<p>In March, 1556, William Carman, of Hingham, was <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>burnt in
Lollards&rsquo; pit, outside of Bishop&rsquo;s Gate.&nbsp; He was
charged with being an obstinate heretic, and actually having in
his possession a bible, a testament, and three psalters in the
English tongue.</p>
<p>On July 13th, of the same year, Simon Miller, merchant of
Lynn, and Elizabeth Cooper, a pewterer&rsquo;s wife, of the
parish of St. Andrew, were burnt together in Lollards&rsquo;
pit.&nbsp; On August 5th, Richard Crashfield, of Wymondham,
Thomas Carman, William Seaman, and Thomas Hudson, were burnt for
heresy in the same place.</p>
<p>On July 10th, 1557, Richard Yolman, a devout old minister,
seventy years of age, was burnt for heresy.&nbsp; He had been
curate to that learned and pious martyr, Mr. Taylor, of
Hadleigh.</p>
<p>As if a judgment had come on the country for such atrocities,
the quartan ague and a new sickness soon afterwards raged so
violently, that it was said that &ldquo;fire, sword, and
pestilence,&rdquo; had swept away a third part of the men of
England; and it is recorded that ten of the Norwich aldermen fell
victims to the latter scourge.</p>
<p>During this short reign, the city was afflicted by the
presence of those merciless persecutors, Bishop Hopton and
Chancellor Dunnings, at whose instigation several martyrs to the
reformed religion were burnt here in 1557 and 1558.&nbsp; Happily
the career of this bigoted, blood-thirsty, priest-ridden queen,
was cut short, and a new and brighter era dawned upon the
nation.</p>
<h4><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>THE
REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.</h4>
<p>This queen ascended the throne on Nov. 7th, 1558, and was
proclaimed here on the 17th of the same month.&nbsp; She was a
zealous promoter of the Reformation.&nbsp; The form of worship
used in the churches was similar to that in the time of Edward
VI.; but the protestants were almost as intolerant in this reign
as the Romanists had been before, though they claimed the right
of private judgment; and the principle of toleration was not
recognised for centuries by any church, or sect, or party.</p>
<p>In 1561, on the Guild day, the Duke of Norfolk, and the Earls
of Northumberland and Huntingdon, with many other nobility and
gentry, dined with the Mayor, William Mingay, Esq., in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, which could scarcely contain the company and
their retinue.&nbsp; The entertainment is said to have been very
magnificent, and the expense of the feast amounted to 32s.
9d.</p>
<p>In 1565, the prosperity of the city, which had begun to
decline, was again revived by the settling here of 330 Flemings
and Walloons, who had fled from the Netherlands, from the rigid
persecution under the sanguinary Duke of Alva.&nbsp; In 1570, by
the fostering encouragement of Queen Elizabeth, the number of
these foreign settlers had increased to 3925, and by the
introduction of bombazine, and other manufactures, they
contributed much to the wealth and prosperity of Norwich.</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>During the long reign of Elizabeth, numerous
conspiracies were formed for the re-establishment of Popery, and
in 1570, John Throgmorton, Thomas Brooke, and G. Redman, were
hanged and quartered here for having joined in these traitorous
enterprises.&nbsp; In 1572, the Duke of Norfolk and several other
noblemen were attainted and beheaded for similar offences, at
London, York, and other places.&nbsp; The Duke not only espoused
the cause of Mary, Queen of Scots, but even offered to marry that
Roman Catholic Princess.</p>
<p>In 1574, a rumour was spread of invasion by the so-called
invincible Armada.&nbsp; Norwich, towards the general defence,
exhibited on its muster roll 2120 able men, of whom 400 were
armed; the total number enrolled in the whole county of Norfolk,
being at the same time, 6120 able men, of whom 3630 were
armed.&nbsp; Happily there was no occasion for their services,
the Armada being destroyed by a storm at sea.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth made a progress through Suffolk and Norfolk,
from the 16th to the 22nd August, 1578.&nbsp; She came on
horseback from Ipswich to Norwich, though she had several coaches
in her train; and she lodged in the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace.&nbsp;
For several days she was entertained by splendid pageantries,
principally allusive to the trade and manufactures of the
city.&nbsp; Whilst here she dined publicly in the North Alley of
the Cathedral Cloister, and often went a hunting on horseback,
and to witness wrestling and shooting on Mousehold heath.&nbsp;
The city records contain full details of the pageantries on the
occasion of the royal visit.&nbsp; In no other city was the Queen
received with greater <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>cordiality and pageantry than in
Norwich.&nbsp; The corporation, the inhabitants, the clergy, with
the nobility and gentry of the county, contributed largely to
afford the royal lady as pleasant and costly a reception as
should be pleasing to her as a spectacle, and demonstrative of
exuberant loyalty.&nbsp; This joy was soon turned into mourning;
for, says a record known as the <i>Norwich Roll</i>, &ldquo;The
trains of Her Majesty&rsquo;s carriage being many of them
infected, left the plague behind them, which afterwards increased
and contynued, as it raged about a year and three
quarters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nearly 5000 fell victims to this dreadful
malady.</p>
<p>In 1578, Matthew Hamond, of Hethersett, wheelwright, a heretic
and blasphemer, being convicted of reviling the queen and of
denying the authority of the Scriptures, the Godhead, the
atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the existence of the Holy
Ghost, was set in the pillory on May 13th, and both his ears were
nailed.&nbsp; Afterwards, on May 20th, he was burnt in the castle
ditch.&nbsp; In 1587 and 1588 Francis Knight and Peter Cole, of
Ipswich, were burnt in the same place for their deistical
sentiments.</p>
<p>The Reformation was not only stayed, but thrown backward by
this arbitrary, despotic queen.&nbsp; Though she was well
disposed to reformation in the abstract, yet the fear of popish
influence and a jealousy for her ecclesiastical authority over
the church, made her act in the spirit of the worst excesses of
popery.&nbsp; She persecuted all who disputed her authority in
religious matters.&nbsp; In vain did the exiles return, hoping
for peace and &ldquo;freedom to worship God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
expulsion <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>of a multitude of clergy, who refused to conform to
many impositions, and the many hardships suffered by the
puritans, especially in Norfolk and Suffolk, evinced that no
concession was to be expected from her.&nbsp; Her great idol was
perfect uniformity.&nbsp; To enforce it, she passed many laws,
which made nonconformity worse than felony, and she treated the
Puritan as a rebel against all authority, both human and
divine.&nbsp; A beautiful &ldquo;Memorial&rdquo; of the ministers
of Norfolk is still preserved in vindication of their loyalty,
and in advocacy of greater liberty of conscience.&nbsp; The
result of it, however, was that seven or eight of them were
suspended in Norwich.&nbsp; But instead of this being the means
of stopping the progress of Puritanism, the sincere inquirers
after truth were incited by such harsh measures to fresh
investigations, and more emboldened to declare their views.</p>
<p>In 1582, on a second return made of the strangers settled
here, they were found to be 1128 men; 1358 women; 815 children,
strangers born; 1378 children, English born; in all 4679.&nbsp;
The whole population was about 15,000, and the citizens continued
to return burgesses to parliament from time to time, but not so
frequently as in former reigns.&nbsp; During this reign William
Kemp, a comic actor of high reputation, and greatly applauded for
his buffoonery, danced a morris dance all the way from London to
Norwich in nine days, and was accompanied by crowds of people as
he passed on from town to town.&nbsp; When he arrived in Norwich
he was very kindly treated by the citizens, who turned out to
meet him in large numbers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span><span
class="smcap">Norwich Pageants</span> were celebrated during the
middle ages, and occupy a large space in the records of the
corporation.&nbsp; Books of the several companies relating to the
pageants have been lost except that of St. George, but some
additional information has come to light on the subject.&nbsp; A
series of extracts were made early in the last century from the
Grocers&rsquo; book, showing the proceedings and expenditure of
that company in regard to their pageants from 1534 to 1570, and
also the versions of the plays in 1533 and in 1563.&nbsp; All the
plays of that period were called mysteries or miracle plays, and
were founded on bible history.&nbsp; The play was performed in a
carriage called a &ldquo;House of Waynscott, painted and builded
on a cart with fowre whelys.&rdquo;&nbsp; Painted cloths were
hung about it, and it was drawn by four horses, &ldquo;having
head stalls of brode inkle with knoppes and tassels.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The vehicle had a square top with a large vane in the midst, and
one for the end, and a large number of smaller ones.&nbsp; The
company was evidently unable to afford the cost of four horses in
1534; only one was hired, and four men attended on the pageant
with &ldquo;Lewers.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the plays was called
&ldquo;Paradyse,&rdquo; and was performed by the Grocers and
Raffmen.&nbsp; It begins much in the same manner as the Coventry
play, with God the Father relating the planting of the garden of
Eden, the creation of man and placing him there, and God&rsquo;s
intention to create woman.&nbsp; The other characters are
Lucifer, Adam, and Eve, who exhibit the incidents related in
Genesis.&nbsp; Of the good taste or propriety of these
entertainments any <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>observation is needless.&nbsp; They formed a remarkable
feature in the life of the middle ages, and show the childishness
of the people.&nbsp; The dialogues in all these plays are puerile
doggerel.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Eminent Citizens of the Sixteenth
Century</span>.</h4>
<h5><i>Dr. Legge</i>.</h5>
<p>Few of the citizens of Norwich could make any pretensions as
to birth, whatever they might say about their birth-place.&nbsp;
Among the natives of this city of obscure parentage may be
mentioned Thomas Legge, LL.D., who was educated in Trinity
College, where he was fellow, as also at Jesus College, till he
was chosen by Dr. Kaye as second master of Kaye&rsquo;s
College.&nbsp; He was Dean of the Arches, one of the Masters of
Chancery, twice Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge,
and thirty-four years Master of Kaye&rsquo;s College.&nbsp;
Justus Lipsius eulogised him as a very excellent antiquary, and
as an oracle of learning.&nbsp; He was a great benefactor to this
college, bequeathing &pound;600 for the building of the east part
thereof, besides several lesser liberalities.&nbsp; Thomas Bacon,
the fifteenth Master of Gonville Hall, had done great damage to
it, and left it in debt; but Dr. Legge and his two successors
repaired all losses, acting not so much like the masters as the
stewards of the house.&nbsp; Dr. Legge was the author of two
tragedies, namely, &ldquo;The Destruction of Jerusalem,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Life of King Richard III.,&rdquo; which last was
performed before Queen <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>Elizabeth, with great applause, in
St. John&rsquo;s College Hall.&nbsp; The doctor died July 12th,
1607, leaving the college his heir, and he was buried in it, so
that he left his native city only the barren honour of his
name.</p>
<h5><i>John Kaye</i>.</h5>
<p>John Kaye, or as he is sometimes called, Caius, was born at
Norwich in 1510, and studied in Gonville Hall, Cambridge, from
which he removed to travel abroad.&nbsp; He took his degree of
M.D. in the University of Padua.&nbsp; In the reign of Edward VI.
he was appointed principal physician at court, a place which he
enjoyed under both the Queens Mary and Elizabeth.&nbsp; The
College of Physicians of London elected him one of their Fellows,
and he presided over that body several years.&nbsp; Being very
rich and desirous to promote learning, he procured a charter from
Queen Elizabeth dated 1565, to turn Gonville Hall into a College;
and he endowed it with the greater part of his estate.&nbsp; He
lived as an ornament to his profession till July, 1573, when he
died, aged 63, at Cambridge.&nbsp; He wrote the
&ldquo;Antiquities of Cambridge,&rdquo; an excellent book; and he
presented it to James I. as he passed through his college.&nbsp;
The King said, &ldquo;Give me rather <i>Caius de
Canibus</i>,&rdquo; a work of his as much admired, but hard to be
got.&nbsp; He was master of his college for some time, but in his
old age he resigned that office to Dr. Legge, a fellow commoner
in his college, and a native of Norwich.</p>
<h5><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span><i>Archbishop Parker</i>.</h5>
<p>Archbishop Parker, a native of Norwich, flourished in this
reign, and was a great benefactor to the city.&nbsp; He was born
August 6th, 1504, being the son of William Parker, a wealthy
citizen.&nbsp; He was educated at the Grammar School here, and in
1520 he was sent to Corpus Christi College, where he took his
degrees of B.A., M.A., and D.D., before 1538.&nbsp; The Queen
afterwards appointed him Archbishop of Canterbury, and he was
very active in persecuting the Puritans here.&nbsp; He was the
author of many works which showed much learning.&nbsp; He died on
May 17th, 1575, and was buried in Lambeth Chapel.</p>

212</span>CHAPTER XII.<br />
Norwich in the Seventeenth Century.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was a very eventful period in
the annals of the city.&nbsp; The century opened with storms and
inundations in the physical world, heralding commotions in the
political world.&nbsp; On April 9th, 1601, a sudden storm of hail
and rain passed over the city, whereby the upper part of the
Cathedral spire, which had been lately repaired, was beaten
down.&nbsp; It fell on the roof of the church, which it broke
through, doing great damage to it as well as to the walls of the
choir.&nbsp; The spire was split on the south-east side from top
to bottom.</p>
<p>James I. was proclaimed king on March 24th, 1602; and soon
after he was seated on the throne he granted a general pardon to
the mayor, sheriffs, and commons of this city, for all past
offences.&nbsp; The local occurrences were not very important
during this reign of 23 years.&nbsp; There were, however, great
disturbances between the citizens and Dutch strangers respecting
trade rights and privileges.</p>
<p><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>In
1602, the plague raged with unusual fury in this country.&nbsp;
As many as 30,578 persons died in London, and 3076 in
Norwich.&nbsp; This visitation was attended with so great a
scarcity of food, that wheat sold for ten, rye for six, and
barley for five shillings per bushel.&nbsp; In the summer of
1609, the city was again visited by the plague, though but few
died of it.</p>
<p>At the assizes held August, 1617, a dispute arose between Sir
Henry Montague, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Queen&rsquo;s
Bench, and John Mingay, Esq., then Mayor, concerning
precedence.&nbsp; This was occasioned by the indiscretion of Sir
Augustine Palgrave, Sheriff of Norfolk, who had imprudently
informed the Chief Justice that it was his right to sit in the
chair at the preaching place in the Green yard, with the Mayor on
his left hand.&nbsp; This the Mayor opposed, resolutely asserting
his right to the chair; and the Chief Justice as resolutely
insisted, being misled by the information of the sheriff.&nbsp;
But this matter was afterwards set right, and the sheriff was
obliged to acknowledge his error, after having been severely
reprimanded by the Judge for misleading him.&nbsp; On the next
day, a contest of the same kind happened between the High Sheriff
and the Sheriffs of Norwich; when, to prevent any disputes of the
like nature in future, it was determined that only the High
Sheriff should attend the Judges when they are upon the county
business, and only the Sheriffs of Norwich when they are on the
city business.</p>
<p>Charles I. was proclaimed king, on March 1st, 1625.&nbsp; The
mayor of Norwich, stewards, justices, sheriffs, and aldermen,
were present at the ceremony.</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>On
March 31st, 1625, Charles I. was proclaimed in Norwich, and on
May 13th following, Thomas, Earl of Arundel and Surrey,
Earl-Marshal of England, was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of the
county of Norfolk, and of the city of Norwich, and county of the
same.</p>
<p>On October 19th, 1625, the citizens petitioned the king to be
released of taxes, on account of their poverty and the ravages of
the plague; and in 1641, the citizens petitioned Parliament, to
be discharged from paying &pound;2500 assessed upon them, on
account of their great poverty and the impossibility of raising
the money.</p>
<p>In 1626, writs of quo warranto were brought against the mayor,
&amp;c., for refusing to furnish two ships of war demanded of
them; and the corporation, on the trial, which took place in
1629, obtained a verdict in their favor, having proved that they
neither used nor usurped any privileges but what their charters
warranted.&nbsp; During this contest the city raised a sum of
money, and presented to the king by way of loan, as settled by
the lord keeper, lord treasurer, comptroller, and chancellor of
the duchy of Lancaster, who came hither for that purpose.</p>
<p>In 1627, an order arrived for levying 250 foot soldiers in the
city of Norwich and county of Norfolk, of which number the
citizens were ordered to furnish 25; but they would raise no more
than 17, that being their full proportion.</p>
<p>During this reign the plague raged with great violence in the
city and county.&nbsp; On July 12th, 1625, the king issued a
commission to the mayor, &amp;c., to <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>scour the city ditches, to remove
all nuisances in and about the city, to repair the walls and
turrets, and to tax all residing in the several wards, according
to their ability, toward the work; it being thought very
necessary, in order to stop the plague which had been brought
from Yarmouth, and begun to spread here.&nbsp; The mayor had
previously requested the bailiffs at Yarmouth to order all the
wherrymen to carry no infected persons dwelling in their town to
the city.&nbsp; Constables of every ward gave notice that no
person coming from London should be entertained without notice
given to the aldermen of their ward; and watch was set at every
gate, day and night, to hinder all persons coming from infected
places entering the city, and the carriers were commanded to
bring no such persons, nor any wool whatever.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding all this caution, the plague began to spread, so
that on July 23rd, the aldermen of every ward appointed
&ldquo;Searchers&rdquo; in each ward, to be keepers of such
persons as were suspected of being infected.&nbsp; The bellman
warned all the citizens to take their dogs and swine outside of
the walls, on pain of being killed.&nbsp; On July 30th, the watch
of the gates ceased, it being known that the plague raged within
the city.&nbsp; Twenty-six persons died of it in that week; and
before August 11th, it had so much increased, that it was
resolved that every alderman should have power to send his
warrants to the city treasurers to relieve the infected persons;
and the plague abated that very week.&nbsp; Orders were issued
that the doors of all persons who died of the disease should be
nailed up and watched.&nbsp; <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>Every one who begged about the
streets was whipped, because all the poor were then relieved, so
that no one had any excuse for begging for food.</p>
<p>In 1634, under date of March 23rd, a letter signed by the
king, was directed to the mayor, sheriff, and aldermen, requiring
their constant attendance at the sermon preached every Sunday
morning, either in the Cathedral or Green yard, and that they
would be there at the beginning of the service, after the manner
observed in the city of London; and that none be absent without
the consent of the bishop.&nbsp; On this point a court was held,
and it was ordered that the mayor and court should constantly
meet at the Free School, and thence proceed to church agreeably
to his majesty&rsquo;s instructions; the king having great regard
for their spiritual welfare.</p>
<h4>THE CIVIL WARS.</h4>
<p>The first parliament of the reign of Charles I., in 1625, has
been severely censured on account of the penurious supply which
it doled out for the exigencies of a war in which its
predecessors had involved the king.&nbsp; Nor is the reproach
wholly unfounded.&nbsp; A more liberal proceeding, if it did not
obtain a reciprocal concession from the king, would have put him
more in the wrong.&nbsp; But the Puritans in parliament formed a
majority, and were determined not to vote money without a redress
of what they deemed to be grievances.&nbsp; The king finding he
could not obtain the supplies he required from the House of
Commons, determined to <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>rule without a parliament, and to
raise money by some other means.&nbsp; Hence the contests between
the king and the parliaments, which were often called and soon
dissolved.&nbsp; This served only to aggravate the embarrassments
of the crown.&nbsp; Every successive House of Commons inherited
the feelings of its predecessor, otherwise it would not have
represented the people.&nbsp; The same men, for the most part,
came again to parliament more irritated and difficult of
reconciliation with the sovereign than before.&nbsp; Even the
politic measure, as it was fancied to be, of excluding some of
the most active members from seats, by nominating them sheriffs
for the year, failed of the expected success because all ranks
partook of a common enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In 1642, July 12th, the parliament voted and declared the
necessity of recourse to arms, and on the 29th of the same month,
Moses Treswell was apprehended for attempting to enlist men into
the king&rsquo;s service, after having been forbidden to do so by
the corporation.&nbsp; The citizens supposing that this act would
be deemed a declaration against their sovereign, ordered a double
watch to be set in every ward, and a provision of all military
stores to be made.&nbsp; They received a letter from the
parliament thanking them for their great services in sending up
Captain Treswell, and exhorting them to raise the militia, and to
prevent anyone from levying troops within their jurisdiction
without consent of parliament.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, the king
issued proclamations requiring the assistance of his subjects
against the rebels, but no regard was <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>paid to them in Norwich.&nbsp; On
the other hand, the magistrates ordered a general muster of the
trained bands and volunteers, and put the city into the best
state of defence, fearing an attack from the gentlemen of Norfolk
and Suffolk who had declared for the king.&nbsp; As a further
proof of their zeal they sent fifty Dragoons for Colonel
Cromwell&rsquo;s regiment, which composed part of the troops
under Lord Grey of Wark, raised for the preservation of the peace
in the associated counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex,
Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, and Huntingdonshire.&nbsp; As soon
as these had marched, the magistrates raised a hundred more
dragoons, and to mount them, gave orders for seizing the horses
of those citizens who favoured the cause of the king, and who
were called malignants.&nbsp; On March 13th, the city raised
fifty more Dragoons, and on March 26th, 1643, a hundred men were
ordered to be raised and sent to Cambridge to re-enforce the
associated army.&nbsp; The weekly contribution levied by
parliament on the county was &pound;1250 in the following
proportions: Norfolk &pound;1129, Norwich &pound;53, Lynn
&pound;27, Yarmouth &pound;34 16s. 5d., Thetford &pound;5 11s.
9d.&nbsp; On April 2nd, being Easter day, Captain Sherwood
marched to Lynn with a hundred volunteers to secure that town
from any sudden surprise by the king&rsquo;s forces.&nbsp; On
August 12th, a meeting of the associated counties was appointed
on account of the danger with which the city was threatened by
the approach of the enemy, and the castle was ordered to be
fortified.&nbsp; Lincolnshire was also admitted amongst the
associated counties.&nbsp; Lynn was garrisoned by the <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>forces of
the parliament, and fortified at the expense of the
Association.&nbsp; On November 18th, four of the Court,
representing the Association, were fined &pound;10 each for want
of expedition in collecting the proposition money, and the Earl
of Manchester ordered the immediate assessing and levying of such
sums of money as should have been raised by any edict of
parliament.&nbsp; This stringent commission was carried out by
force of arms.</p>
<p>In 1643, it having been agreed between the English and Scotch
commissioners that &pound;100,000 should be immediately advanced
to the Scots, to enable them to put their army in march for
England, an order was sent down to Norwich for levying
&pound;6000, part of the said sum in the following proportions;
in Norwich, &pound;265; in Yarmouth, &pound;174; in Lynn,
&pound;132; in Thetford, &pound;27 18s. 9d., and the remainder in
the county of Norfolk.</p>
<p>By order of the Court, on March 9th, 1644, seven pictures,
taken from St. Swithin&rsquo;s Church, the Angel and Four
Evangelists from St. Peter&rsquo;s, Moses and Aaron and the Four
Evangelists from the Cathedral, and other paintings, were
publicly burnt in the Market Place.&nbsp; A committee was
appointed to &ldquo;view the churches for pictures and
crucifixes,&rdquo; in consequence of which, these over-zealous
Reformers committed all kinds of outrages and excesses by
destroying monuments in the churches, and burning valuable
paintings, as stated by Bishop Hall in his &ldquo;Hard
Measure,&rdquo; a pamphlet on the proceedings of the
Puritans.&nbsp; On Christmas eve, 1645, the mayor issued <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>orders to
all the city clergy commanding them neither to preach, nor to
administer the sacrament, in their respective churches on the day
following, and to the inhabitants, charging them to open their
shops as on other days; so little did the Puritans in that age
understand the principles of toleration.</p>
<p>In 1648, a petition was presented to the mayor, &amp;c.,
signed by 150 persons, praying for a more speedy and effectual
reformation, and complaining that their faithful ministers were
discouraged and slighted; the ejected ministers countenanced and
preferred; old ceremonies, and the service book constantly used,
and the directory for worship almost totally neglected; and
further praying, that the ordinances against superstition and
idolatry might be put in strict execution; &ldquo;so, shall the
crucifix on the cathedral gate be defaced, and another on the
roof of the cathedral neere the west door in the inside, and one
upon the free school, and the image of Christ on the parish house
of St. George at Tombland be taken down, and many parish churches
more decently made for the congregations to meet in.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The mayor, John Utting, paying little regard to this petition,
was sent for to London, and Mr. Alderman Baret put in his
place.&nbsp; After he was gone, the common people, having a great
affection for the mayor, went to the committee house, then on the
site of the present Bethel, where the gunpowder was kept, and set
fire to ninety-five barrels, which killed and wounded about one
hundred persons and greatly damaged the adjacent buildings.&nbsp;
For this <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>outrage six of the perpetrators were hanged in the
Market Place.</p>
<p>On January 30th, 1649, King Charles was beheaded at
Whitehall.&nbsp; Soon after the death of the king the House of
Commons published a decree to forbid the proclaiming of Charles
Stuart, eldest son of the late king, or of any person whatsoever,
on pain of high treason; and afterwards enacted that the kingly
office should be abolished as unnecessary, burdensome, and
dangerous; and that the state should be governed by the
representatives of the people without king or lords, and under
the form of a Commonwealth.</p>
<p>In 1650, on discovery of an intended insurrection in Norfolk
in favour of King Charles, which was to have broken out on
October 7th, several of the conspirators were apprehended and
tried at the new hall, in Norwich, before three judges,
commissioned by the parliament for that purpose.&nbsp; Their
sitting continued from December 20th to December 30th, and they
condemned twenty-five persons, who were all executed, some of
them at Norwich and others in different parts of Norfolk.</p>
<p>On June 24th, 1654, an ordinance was published for the six
months&rsquo; assessment for the maintenance of the armies and
fleets of the Commonwealth, at the rate of &pound;120,000 per
month for the first three months, and &pound;90,000 per month for
the rest.&nbsp; Towards each monthly payment of the last sum,
Norwich raised &pound;240 and Norfolk &pound;4660.&nbsp; On
August 29th, an ordinance was issued for ejecting scandalous and
insufficient ministers and schoolmasters; whose qualifications <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>were to be
tried by commissioners appointed for that purpose in every
county.&nbsp; In consequence of this ordinance many able divines
in the kingdom were ejected from their livings, and their places
filled by such as best suited the views of the ruling
party.&nbsp; During the Commonwealth, the city was put in defence
against the royalists, the castle was fortified for the service
of Cromwell, the goods of the bishops and clergy were
sequestrated, the bishops palace was sacked, the cathedral and
churches were plundered and defaced, and Bishop Hall was turned
out and driven into retirement at his palace in Heigham, which is
still in existence, being used as a tavern called the
Dolphin.&nbsp; He died there and was buried in the old church in
Heigham.&nbsp; We shall speak more at length of this
distinguished prelate in our notice of &ldquo;The Eminent
Citizens&rdquo; of the 17th century.</p>
<p>On the death of Oliver Cromwell, which happened on September
3rd, 1658, the mayor of Norwich, like the mayors of other towns,
received letters from the privy council, notifying that event and
the election of his son Richard Cromwell to the dignity of
Protector, and commanding him to proclaim the said Richard
protector of the three kingdoms, which was done accordingly on
the seventh of that month.&nbsp; The new protector&rsquo;s
honours were, however, but of short continuance; for in the month
of April, 1659, the army obliged him to dissolve the parliament
which he had convoked, and soon afterwards deposed him from his
high office.&nbsp; During the fatal contentions respecting the
prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>parliament,
the city suffered less than might have been expected, and Norfolk
less than many other counties.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The citizens, tired of strife and commotion, were among the
first to hail the return of monarchy in the person of Charles
II., who was proclaimed here on May 10th, 1660, and the sum of
&pound;1000 was presented to His Majesty, on behalf of the city,
by the mayor, who received the honour of knighthood.&nbsp; In
1663 the king granted to the city the charter by which, with
little interruption, it was governed till 1835, when the
municipal act came into force.&nbsp; In 1670, Lord Howard
presented the corporation with a noble mace of silver gilt, and a
gown of crimson velvet for the mayor.&nbsp; In 1671, the king and
queen and many nobles visited the city, and were entertained in
grand style at the palaces of the bishop and the Duke of
Norfolk.</p>
<p>In 1682, a majority of the corporation surrendered to the king
the charter which he had granted them nine years before, and in
lieu of it a new one was substituted not so favourable to the
city; the king having reserved the right of removing magistrates
of whom he did not approve.</p>
<p>In 1687, by the mandate of James II., ten aldermen and
nineteen councillors were displaced; but the arbitrary conduct of
that monarch soon brought about his ruin, and when Henry, Duke of
Norfolk, rode into the Market Place at the head of 300 knights
and gentlemen and declared for a <i>free</i> parliament, the
corporation and citizens responded with loud acclamations.&nbsp;
After the glorious revolution of 1688, the first <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>charter of
Charles II. was restored to the city, and the aldermen who had
been removed were reinstated in their offices.</p>
<p>William and Mary, king and queen of England, began their reign
on February 13th, 1688, and during their reign the city
flourished exceedingly, and the country in general was
prosperous.</p>
<p>In 1697 the coin was regulated afresh, the old money being
called in and recoined, for which purpose, mints were established
in various places, among others one in this city, which coined
&pound;259,371.&nbsp; The quantity of coin and plate brought in
here to be coined was 17,709 ounces.</p>
<p>We may here give the statements of two eminent writers
respecting Norwich and Norfolk in this century.&nbsp; Sir Thomas
Browne, jun., in 1662, wrote as follows about the city and
county:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let any stranger find me out so pleasant a
county, such good ways, large heaths, three such places as
Norwich, Yarmouth, and Lynn, in any county of England, and
I&rsquo;ll be once again a vagabond and visit to them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he wrote so with good reason.&nbsp; Few, if any, of the
cities of England then contained more handsome buildings, or
presented so good an appearance as did the old city of Norwich,
while only London and Bristol surpassed her in the extent and
importance of their commerce.&nbsp; Lord Macaulay, in his graphic
History of England thus describes the state of the city in the
17th century:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>&ldquo;Norwich was the capital of a large and fruitful
province.&nbsp; It was the residence of a bishop and of a
chapter.&nbsp; It was the seat of the manufacture of the
realm.&nbsp; Some even distinguished by learning and science had
recently dwelt there, and no place in the kingdom, except the
capital and the universities, had more attractions to the
curious.&nbsp; The library, the museum, the aviary, and the
botanical gardens of Sir Thomas Browne were thought by the
Fellows of the Royal Society well worthy of a long
pilgrimage.&nbsp; Norwich had also a court in miniature.&nbsp; In
the heart of the city stood an old palace of the Duke of Norfolk,
said to be the largest town house in the kingdom out of
London.&nbsp; In this mansion, to which were annexed a tennis
court, a bowling green, and a wilderness extending along the
banks of the Wensum, the noble family of Howard frequently
resided.&nbsp; Drink was served to the guests in goblets of pure
gold; the very tongs and shovels were of silver; pictures of
Italian masters adorned the walls; the cabinets were filled with
a fine collection of gems purchased by the Earl of Arundel, whose
marbles are now among the ornaments of Oxford.&nbsp; Here, in the
year 1671, Charles and his court were sumptuously entertained;
here, too, all comers were annually welcomed from Christmas to
Twelfthnight; ale flowed in oceans for the populace.&nbsp; Three
coaches, one of which had been built at a cost of &pound;500 to
contain fourteen persons, were sent every afternoon round the
city to bring ladies to the festivities, and the dances were
always followed by a luxurious banquet.&nbsp; When the Duke of
Norfolk came to Norwich he was greeted like a king returning to
his capital; the bells of St. Peter&rsquo;s Mancroft were rung,
the guns of the castle were fired, and the mayor and aldermen
waited on their illustrious citizen with complimentary
addresses.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>Eminent Citizens of the Seventeenth Century.</h4>
<h5><i>Bishop Hall</i>.</h5>
<p>Dr. Hall, Bishop of Norwich, the first English Satirist, was a
noted character in this century.&nbsp; He was born July 1st,
1574, in Bristow Park, within the parish of Ashby de la Zouch, in
Leicestershire.&nbsp; He was educated by a private tutor till he
was fifteen years of age, when he removed to Cambridge, and was
admitted to Emmanuel College, of which he was a chosen scholar,
and took the degree of Bachelor of Arts.&nbsp; His satires were
published in 1597, 1598, and 1599, and added greatly to his
reputation by their pungency and classical style.&nbsp; They
equal the satires of Juvenal and Persius on similar themes, and
in lashing the vices of the age.</p>
<p>Dr. Hall, in 1624, refused the bishopric of Gloucester, but in
1627 he accepted that of Exeter, holding with it <i>in
commendam</i> the rectory of St. Breock in Cornwall.&nbsp; At
this time he seems to have been suspected of a leaning to the
Puritans, and it must be allowed that his religious views were
more consonant with theirs than with the lax Arminianism of
Laud.&nbsp; But at the same time, Dr. Hall was a zealous
supporter of the church.</p>
<p>On November 15th, 1641, he was translated, by the little power
left to the king, to be Bishop of Norwich, but having joined with
the Archbishop of York and eleven other prelates, in a protest
against the validity of such laws as should be made during their
compulsory <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>absence from parliament, he was ordered to be sent to
the tower, with his brethren, on the 30th of January
following.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards they were impeached by the
Commons for high treason, and on their appearance in parliament
were treated with the utmost rudeness and contempt.&nbsp; The
Commons, however, did not think fit to prosecute the charge of
high treason, having gained their purpose by driving them from
the House of Lords, and Hall and his brethren were ordered to be
dismissed; but upon another pretext they were again sent to the
tower.&nbsp; In June following, Hall was finally released on
giving bail for &pound;5000!&nbsp; He returned to Norwich, and
being received with rather more respect than he hoped for, in the
then state of public opinion, he resumed his duties, frequently
preaching to large congregations, and enjoying the forbearance of
the predominant Puritan party till April, 1643, when the
destruction of the church was contemplated.&nbsp; About this
time, the ordinance for sequestrating notorious delinquents
having passed, and our prelate being included by name, all his
rents were stopped, his palace was entered, and all his property
was seized.&nbsp; A friend, however, gave bond for the whole
amount of the valuation, and the bishop was allowed to remain a
short time in his palace.&nbsp; While he remained there, he was
continually exposed to the insolence of the soldiery and mob, who
demolished the windows and monuments of the cathedral.&nbsp; At
length he was ordered to leave his palace, and would have been
exposed to the utmost extremity, if a neighbour had not <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>offered him
the shelter of his humble roof.&nbsp; Some time afterwards, but
by what interest we are not told, the sequestration was taken off
a small estate which he rented at Heigham, to which he
retired.&nbsp; The house in which he lived, now called the
Dolphin Inn, is still standing, and should be carefully preserved
as a memorial of a great and good man.</p>
<p>Bishop Hall, in his tract <i>Hard Measure</i>, has given a
most touching account of the treatment he experienced.&nbsp; He
says in his tract &ldquo;The Shaking of the Olive
Tree:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is no other than tragical to relate the
carnage of that furious sacrilege whereof our eyes and ears were
the sad witnesses, under the authority and presence of Linsey,
Tofts the sheriff, and Greenwood.&nbsp; Lord, what work was here;
what clattering of glasses, what beating down of walls, what
tearing up of monuments, what pulling down of seates, what
wresting out of irons and brass from the windows and graves, what
defacing of armes, what demolishing of curious stone work which
had not any representation in the world, but only of the cast of
the founder, and skill of the mason; what toting and piping upon
the destroyed organ pipes, and what a hideous triumph on the
market day, before all the country, when, in a sacrilegious and
profane procession, all the organ pipes, vestments, both copes
and surplices, together with the leaden crosse which had been
newly sawn down from over the green yard pulpit, and the service
book and singing books that could be had, were carried to a fire
in the public Market-place; a lewd wretch walking before the
train in his cope trailing in the dirt, with a service book in
his hand, imitating in an impious scorne the tune and usurping
the words of the litany formerly used in the church.&nbsp; Neer
the <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>publick crosse all these monuments of idolatry must be
sacrificed to the fire, not without much ostentation of a zealous
joy in discharging ordinance to the cost of some who professed
how much they longed to see that day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The good bishop&rsquo;s sufferings did not damp his courage,
for in 1644, we find him preaching in Norwich whenever he could
obtain the use of a pulpit; and with yet more boldness, in the
same year he sent <i>A modest offer of some meet considerations
in favour of Episcopacy</i> addressed to the Assembly of
Divines.&nbsp; During the rest of his life he appears to have
remained at Heigham, unmolested, performing the duties of a
faithful pastor, and exercising such hospitality and charity as
his scanty means permitted.&nbsp; He died, September 8th, 1656,
in the 82nd year of his age, and was buried in the church of St.
Bartholomew, in Heigham.&nbsp; In his will, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I leave my body to be buried without any
funeral pomp, at the discretion of my executors, with the only
monition that I do not hold God&rsquo;s house a meet repository
for the dead bodies of the greatest saints.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He left a family behind, according to Lloyd, of whom Robert,
the eldest son, was afterwards a clergyman, and D.D.&nbsp; His
wife died in 1647.&nbsp; His prose works were published at
various periods in folio, quarto, and duodecimo.&nbsp; They were
collected in a handsome edition of 10 vols., octavo, by the Rev.
Josiah Pratt, and are his best memorials.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Meditations&rdquo; have been often reprinted.&nbsp; As a
moralist, he has been called the British Seneca.</p>
<h5><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span><i>Sir Thomas Browne</i>.</h5>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne flourished in this century in Norwich, as a
Physician.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson wrote a memoir of him, from which we
learn the following particulars.&nbsp; He was born in London, in
the parish of St. Michael, in Cheapside, on October 19th,
1605.&nbsp; Of his childhood or youth there is little known,
except that he lost his father very early; that he was, according
to the common fate of orphans, defrauded by one of his guardians;
and that he was placed for his education at the School of
Winchester.&nbsp; He was removed in 1623 from Winchester to
Oxford, and entered a gentleman commoner of Broadgate Hall, which
was soon afterwards endowed and took the name of Pembroke
College, from the Earl of Pembroke, the Chancellor of the
University.&nbsp; He was admitted to the degree of B.A., January
31st, 1626&ndash;7, being the first man of eminence who graduated
from the new college, to which the zeal or gratitude of those
that love it most can wish little better than that it may long
proceed as it began.&nbsp; Having afterwards taken his degree of
M.A., he turned his attention to physic.&nbsp; He practised it
for some time in Oxfordshire, but soon afterwards, either induced
by curiosity or invited by promises, he quitted his settlement
and accompanied his father-in-law, who had some employment in
Ireland in the visitation of the forts and castles, which the
state of Ireland then made necessary.&nbsp; He left Ireland and
travelled on the Continent, and was created an M.D. at
Leyden.&nbsp; About the year 1634 he is supposed to have returned
to <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>London; and the next year to have written his
celebrated treatise, called <i>Religio Medici</i>, or, &ldquo;The
Religion of a Physician,&rdquo; which excited the attention of
the public by the novelty of paradoxes, the dignity of sentiment,
the quick succession of images, the multitude of abstruse
allusions, the subtlety of disquisition, and the strength of
language.&nbsp; At the time when this book was published the
author resided at Norwich, where he had settled in 1636, by the
persuasion of Dr. Lushington, his tutor, who was then rector of
Burnham Westgate, in West Norfolk.&nbsp; His practice became very
extensive, and in 1637 he was incorporated Doctor of Physic, in
Oxford.&nbsp; He married in 1641, Mrs. Mileham, of a good family
in Norfolk.&nbsp; He had ten children by her, of whom one son and
three daughters survived their parents.&nbsp; In 1646, Sir Thomas
Browne published his &ldquo;Enquiries into Vulgar and Common
Errors,&rdquo; which passed through many editions.&nbsp; In 1658,
the discovery of some ancient urns in Norfolk, gave him occasion
to write &ldquo;Hydriotaphia, Urn-burial, or, a Discourse of
Sepulchral Urns;&rdquo; in which he treats with his usual
learning on the funeral rites of ancient nations, exhibits their
various treatment of the dead, and examines the substances found
in the Norfolcian urns.&nbsp; To this treatise on Urn-burial was
added the &ldquo;Garden of Cyrus; or, the Quincuxial Lozenge, or
Network Plantation of the Ancients, Artificially, Naturally,
Mystically Considered.&rdquo;&nbsp; He doubted the Copernican
hypothesis, on the same ground as some divines distrust the
Cuvierian system of Geology, as opposed to Genesis.&nbsp; These
were all <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>the tracts which he published, but many papers were
found in his closet.&nbsp; Of these, two collections were
published in 1722, and all his works were issued in a cheap form
by G. H. Bohn, and are in the Norwich Free Library.&nbsp; To the
life of this learned man there remains little to be added, but
that in 1665 he was chosen Honorary Fellow of the College of
Physicians, as a man &ldquo;<i>Virtute et literis
ornatissimus</i>,&rdquo; eminently embellished with literature
and virtue.&nbsp; In 1671, he received at Norwich, the honour of
Knighthood from Charles II., a prince, who, with many frailties
and vices, had yet skill to discover excellence and virtue, to
reward it with such honorary distinctions, at least, as cost him
nothing.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne, in 1680, wrote a <i>Repertorium</i>, or
Account of the Tombs and Monuments in the Cathedral Church of
Norwich.&nbsp; The basis of the work was a sketch hastily drawn
up twenty years previously on the information of &ldquo;an
understanding singing man,&rdquo; ninety-one years old, in order
to preserve the remembrance of some of the monumental antiquities
which barbarous zeal had destroyed.&nbsp; The reckless character
of these ravages has thus been exhibited in a description made on
the spot and at the moment, by one who suffered in his person,
property, and health.</p>
<p>Thus the knight lived in high reputation, till he was seized
with a colic, which, after having tortured him for about a week,
put an end to his life at Norwich, on his birthday, October 19th,
1682, having completed his 77th year.&nbsp; Some of his last
words were expressions <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>of submission to the will of God,
and fearlessness of death.&nbsp; He lies buried in the Church of
St. Peter Mancroft, within the rails at the east end of the
chancel, with this inscription on a mural monument, placed in the
south pillar of the altar:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Simon Wilkin, F.L.S., in a supplementary memoir, states
that Dr. Browne steadily adhered to the royal cause in perilous
times.&nbsp; He was one of the 432 principal citizens, who, in
1643, refused to subscribe towards a fund for regaining the town
of Newcastle.&nbsp; Charles II. was not likely to have been
ignorant of this, and he had, no doubt, the good feeling to
express his sense of it by a distinction which was, no doubt,
gratifying to Sir Thomas Browne.&nbsp; Sir Thomas is supposed to
have lived in the last house <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>at the south end of the
Gentleman&rsquo;s Walk, where the Savings&rsquo; Bank now
stands.&nbsp; Blomefield asserts that he lived where Dr. Howman
then lived, (1760) and that he succeeded Alderman Anguish in that
house; and Mr. Simon Wilkin says that he ascertained by reference
to title deeds, that the last house at the southern extremity of
the Gentleman&rsquo;s Walk, Haymarket, belonged, in
Blomefield&rsquo;s time, to Dr. Howman.&nbsp; This house was for
many years a china and glass warehouse, and tradition has always
asserted it to be Dr. Browne&rsquo;s residence.&nbsp; The last
occupier was Mr. Swan, and the house was pulled down to make room
for the Savings&rsquo; Bank.&nbsp; It contained some spacious
rooms.&nbsp; In the drawing room there was, over the mantel-piece
and occupying the entire space of the ceiling, a most elaborate
and richly ornamented carving of the royal arms of Charles II.,
no doubt placed there by Sir Thomas to express his loyalty, and
to commemorate his knighthood.&nbsp; In Matthew Stevenson&rsquo;s
poems, 12mo, 1673, there is a long poem on the progress of
Charles II. into Norfolk, in which the honour conferred on Browne
is thus noticed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There the king knighted the so famous
Browne,<br />
Whose worth and learning to the world are known.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early in October, 1673, Evelyn went down to the Earl of
Arlington&rsquo;s, at Euston, in company with Sir Thomas
Clifford, to join the royal party.&nbsp; Lord Henry Howard
arrived soon afterward, and prevailed on Mr. Evelyn to accompany
him to Norwich, promising to convey him back after a day or
two.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he says, <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>&ldquo;as I
could not refuse I was not hard to be persuaded to, having a
desire to see that famous scholar and physician, Dr. T. Browne,
author of the <i>Religio Medici</i>, and <i>Vulgar Errors</i>,
&amp;c., now lately knighted.&rdquo;&nbsp; After arriving in
Norwich, Evelyn says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Next morning I went to see Sir Thomas
Browne, with whom I had some time corresponded by letter, though
I had never seen him before.&nbsp; His whole house and garden
being a paradise and cabinet of rarities, and that of the best
collections, especially medails, books, plants, and natural
things.&nbsp; Amongst other curiosities, Sir Thomas had a
collection of the eggs of all the foule and birds he could
procure, that country (especially the promontory of Norfolk)
being frequented, as he said, by severall kinds, which seldome or
never go further into the land, as cranes, storkes, eagles, and a
variety of water foule.&nbsp; He led me to see all the remarkable
places in this ancient city, being one of the largest, and
certainly, after London, one of the noblest in England for its
venerable Cathedralle, number of stately churches, cleanesse of
the streets, and buildings of flints so exquistely headed and
squared, as I was much astonished at; but he told me they had
lost the art of squaring the flints in which they once so much
excelled, and of which the churches, best houses, and walls are
built.&nbsp; The Castle is an antique extent of ground which now
they call Marsfield, and would have been a fitting area to have
placed the ducal palace in.&nbsp; The suburbs are large, the
prospects are sweete, with other amenities, not omitting the
flower gardens, in which all the inhabitants excel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time the hamlets of Thorpe, Lakenham, and Heigham,
were all fields or cultivated grounds and gardens, and the city
was interspersed with gardens.</p>

236</span><i>Dr. Samuel Clarke</i>.</h5>
<p>Samuel Clarke, D.D., was the son of Edward Clarke, one of the
Aldermen of Norwich, where he was born in 1675, and where he was
educated at the Grammar School, his father being at that time one
of the representatives of the city in parliament.&nbsp; In 1691,
he was entered as a student in Caius College, Cambridge, where
his great capacity for learning was soon developed, and where he
became distinguished as a metaphysician, mathematician, and
divine.&nbsp; He was the author of many works, the chief of which
was a &ldquo;Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon his entering into holy orders, he became
Chaplain to the learned Dr. Moore, Bishop of Norwich, with whom
he lived in great esteem, having the advantage of the fine
library of that prelate.&nbsp; In 1704, he was called to an
office worthy of all his learning, namely, that of lecturer on
Mr. Boyle&rsquo;s foundation.&nbsp; He preached sermons
concerning the Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion, which
will always be highly esteemed.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, he was
presented to the living of St. Bennet&rsquo;s, near Paul&rsquo;s
Wharf, London, and where he constantly preached without
notes.&nbsp; In the same year he translated the <i>Optics of Sir
Isaac Newton</i> into elegant Latin, which was so acceptable to
that great philosopher, that he presented &pound;500 to the
divine, being &pound;100 for each of his children.&nbsp; He was
soon after made one of the Chaplains in Ordinary, and in 1709,
Queen Anne presented him to the Rectory of St. James&rsquo;,
Westminster, when he went to Cambridge <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>and took
his degree of Doctor of Divinity.&nbsp; He died on May 17th,
1729, aged 54 years.</p>
<h5><i>Robert</i>, <i>Viscount of Yarmouth</i>.</h5>
<p>In 1683 died the Rt. Hon. Robert, Viscount of Yarmouth, Baron
of Paston, Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk and Norwich.&nbsp; He was
buried at Oxnead.&nbsp; His funeral sermon was preached by the
Rev. John Hildeyard, LL.D., then rector of Cawston, and it was
afterwards published.&nbsp; At page 27 there is the following
passage, referring to the deceased viscount:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Great was his love to the ancient, loyal,
and honourable corporation of Norwich, because the members of
that body, generally speaking, loved the king; they found him
their friend and, <i>maugre</i> the blast of calumny, the <i>new
charter</i> shall remain a token of it.&nbsp; He spared no cost
nor pains, as themselves can witness, to make the world believe
that he loved them.&nbsp; Most of the tables of his house were
spread together for their entertainment, and all his friends
employed to bid them welcome; nay, his very sleep was ofttimes
broken to find out ways how best to serve them, and he commended
the care of the city with his last breath, to all his best
friends, and the blessing of God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy corporation, that had such a friend; but Blomefield
says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whatever the Dr. (Hildeyard) might think of
it, the effects of the new charter now began to be too visible,
for Mr. Nic Helwys was chosen mayor, and eleven common council in
room of those eleven of the sixty common council appointed by the
charter, which were not qualified; but such <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>choice was
of no force till confirmed by the king, who sent a letter under
the privy seal, dated at Windsor, May 17th, signifying by the
Earl of Arundel that he approved of them, and the names of the
two elected sheriffs were signified to the Lord Lieutenant, and
that they were persons of loyalty, and therefore they desired his
lordship to give his gracious Majesty information thereof in
order to his approbation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h5><i>Dr. John Cosin</i>.</h5>
<p>John Cosin, D.D., was born in this city in 1594, and finished
his studies in Caius College, Cambridge, where he took his last
degrees.&nbsp; When he entered into holy orders he was presented
to a Prebendary in the Cathedral Church of Durham, and appointed
Archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire.&nbsp; But the civil
wars breaking out, and he being an active Papist, he was obliged
to seek refuge abroad till the Restoration in 1660, when he
returned, and was promoted first to the Deanery of Peterborough,
and then to the Bishopric of Durham.&nbsp; He died at Durham,
aged 78, in 1672.</p>
<h5><i>Dr. John Pearson</i>.</h5>
<p>John Pearson, D.D., was the son of a Clergyman in Norwich,
where he was born in 1613.&nbsp; He received the first rudiments
of learning at Eton, whence he was removed to King&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge, where he finished his studies, and took his
degrees.&nbsp; His first ecclesiastical preferment was a
Prebendary of Salisbury; and soon afterwards he was chosen Rector
of <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>St.
Clements, East Cheap, where he remained till 1660, and where he
wrote his learned explanation of the Creed.&nbsp; At the
Restoration, he was appointed Archdeacon of Surrey, and
afterwards he was promoted to the See of Chester, where he
continued till his death, in 1686.</p>
<h5><i>John Goslin</i>.</h5>
<p>John Goslin, a native of Norwich, flourished in the 17th
century.&nbsp; He was first Fellow and then Master of Caius
College, in Cambridge, Proctor of that University, and thrice
Vice Chancellor thereof, a general scholar, eloquent Latinist,
and a rare physician, in which faculty he was Regius
Professor.&nbsp; He was a great benefactor to Catherine&rsquo;s
Hall, but left his native city only the honour of his name.&nbsp;
He died in 1625.</p>
<h5><i>The Rev. John Carter</i>.</h5>
<p>The Rev. John Carter was an eccentric character in the city
during this century.&nbsp; He was born at Bramford, in Suffolk,
in 1594, and became upper minister of St. Peter Mancroft,
Norwich, which position he held from 1638 to 1653.&nbsp; He
preached three extraordinary sermons before the corporation,
preparatory to the guild day festival in 1644, 1647, and
1650.&nbsp; The title of the first is &ldquo;The Nail Hit on the
Head, and Driven into the City and Cathedral Wall of
Norwich;&rdquo; of the second, &ldquo;The Wheel Turned by a Voice
from the Throne of Glory;&rdquo; and the third, &ldquo;A Rare
Sight; or, <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>the Lyon Sent from a Far Country, and Presented to the
City of Norwich in a Sermon upon the Solemne Guild Day, June
18th, 1650.&rdquo;&nbsp; The third sermon fills 150 pages, is the
length of several modern sermons, and must have occupied two
hours and a half in the delivery; a terrible long grace to a
guild day dinner.&nbsp; It is ornamented with many wood cuts,
among which is the lion in various attitudes, couchant, guardant,
rampant, passant, &amp;c., giving the preacher opportunities of
displaying his knowledge of, at least, the terms of heraldry, and
sarcastically to apply them to the magistracy.&nbsp; He
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In one respect, your city arms do very well
befit you.&nbsp; It is a lion with a castle over it.&nbsp; Many
of you can be like lions, very courageous, so long as you have a
castle over you for protection and countenance; but take away the
castle, and who will expose himself to danger?&nbsp; What a
sordid thing is this!&nbsp; There is a lion couchant, but never
did I hear of a lion crouchant, or current, a fearful and
dastardly lion.&nbsp; Who among you will strike down a disorderly
ale-house, if the brewer that serves it be an alderman, a rich
man, or a friend?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the discourse is replete with coarse expressions,
biting sarcasms, and party prejudices, not likely to have
edified, and much less to have pleased the congregation.</p>

241</span>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
Nonconformity in Norwich.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Church of Rome reigned supreme
over all Europe for a thousand years, but in the 15th century,
reason revolted against her authority.&nbsp; Lutheranism and
Calvinism were the first forms of the revolt on the Continent,
and they assumed the names of Presbyterianism and Puritanism in
England and Scotland.&nbsp; Norwich, in common with Norfolk and
Suffolk, eventually took up the cause of the Reformation with a
zeal and vehemence which make them stand alone in the annals of
history.</p>
<p>Norwich Nonconformists, in times of the fiercest persecution,
held many prohibited meetings, which were sometimes discovered in
different parts of the city.&nbsp; Norfolk, situated as it is in
the eastern coast, was the refuge of many protestants, who fled
from the Netherlands to escape from the severe persecutions of
the infamous Duke of Alva.&nbsp; Even before this time, there
were many in the county and city who objected to the new service
book, or English liturgy, published by the authority of Edward
VI.</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>The
Reformation made much progress here in the reign of this young
and pious king; but even then a disposition lingered to retain
and enforce some of the Romanist rites and ceremonies.&nbsp; The
excellent Bishop Hooper, who after all became a martyr, would
probably have lost his life simply for refusing to wear the
priestly vestments, through the rigour of Bishop Ridley (who
himself afterwards suffered martyrdom) had he not at length
consented to wear them at his consecration.&nbsp; The Baptists,
the Unitarians, and all who went beyond the new state model were
consigned to the flames.</p>
<p>Bishop Hooper was born in the year 1495, and was burnt in the
reign of Queen Mary.&nbsp; The sixty years of his life formed the
most important period of English history.&nbsp; When he was born,
the Reformation had just begun; when he died it had struck such
deep roots amongst the people, especially of Norwich and Norfolk,
that neither force, nor persecution, nor argument could stop its
progress.&nbsp; In Bishop Hooper&rsquo;s time, and in his diocese
of Gloucester, the ignorance of the clergy was amazing.&nbsp; Out
of 311 of his clergy he found 168 unable to repeat the ten
commandments; 31 out of the 168 could not tell in what part of
the Bible the ten commandments were to be found; 40 could not
tell where the Lord&rsquo;s prayer was given, and 31 did not know
who was the author of it.&nbsp; In Norfolk and Norwich the clergy
were quite as ignorant of Scripture.&nbsp; They practised all
kinds of impositions on the people who were debased by
superstition, immorality, and vice.&nbsp; There was over all the
land a <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>darkness which might be felt.&nbsp; The people had no
bibles nor testaments, and the prayers of the church were all in
Latin, and of course the people could not understand them.&nbsp;
There was scarcely any preaching at all, but instead thereof
profane miracle plays were performed in the cathedral, and were
paid for like any other dramatic performance.</p>
<p>In 1574, so notorious was the city for the nonconformity of
many of the ministers, that when orders were given to Archbishop
Parker &ldquo;to punish the Puritan ministers, and put down the
prophecyings, and readings, and commenting on the Scriptures,
which had been introduced into the church,&rdquo; the queen gave
him private orders to begin with Norwich.&nbsp; Accordingly, in
1576, many of the Norwich ministers were suspended and treated so
severely, that even the Norfolk justices presented a petition to
Her Majesty, praying for lenity towards them.</p>
<p>Robert Brown, a clergyman of Norwich, originated the sect of
the Brownists, afterwards called the Independents.&nbsp; He was
at one time a zealous promoter of that system, but English
societies existed before him, holding similar views.&nbsp;
According to Sir Walter Raleigh, 20,000 persons at least held
independent principles of ecclesiastical polity.&nbsp; Amongst
these were many men of great learning and distinction, all of
whom were commanded to quit the realm.&nbsp; Wherever found, they
were imprisoned, with or without law, for life.&nbsp; Elias
Thacker and John Copping suffered death at Bury St.
Edmund&rsquo;s.&nbsp; John Lewis was burnt at Norwich.&nbsp;
Francis Kett, M.A., for holding &ldquo;detestable <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>opinions,&rdquo; was also burnt alive in Norwich.&nbsp;
William Dennys was a martyr in the same cause, at Thetford.&nbsp;
Greenwood, Barrow, and Penry fell as martyrs of conscience.&nbsp;
Johnson, Smith, Answorth, Canne, Robinson, and Jacob, only
escaped by flight to Holland, and found liberty there to form
several churches, and to compose an elaborate account of their
doctrines and principles, a fact which testifies to their
enlightened piety and superior learning.</p>
<p>In the reign of James I. no favour was shown to the Puritans,
but on the contrary, severities were continued.&nbsp; The king
amply fulfilled his threat to the Puritans at the Hampton Court
conference;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>If this be all your party has to
say</i>, <i>I will make them conform or harrie them out of the
land</i>, <i>or else do worse</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; By these
proceedings the country was rendered almost destitute of
preachers, and scandalous men undertook the care of souls in
place of the zealous refugees.&nbsp; This King James published
the &ldquo;Book of Sports,&rdquo; in vindication of the
encouragement of various games on the sabbath day.&nbsp; Bishop
Kennett styles it &ldquo;A trap to catch tender
consciences,&rdquo; and a means of promoting the ease, wealth,
and grandeur of the bishops.&nbsp; This book was, in the next
reign, (Charles I.) republished by the bigotted Archbishop Laud;
and it was ordered to be read in every church throughout the
kingdom.&nbsp; The bishop of Norwich, then Bishop Wren, was very
peremptory on this and other points.&nbsp; He is said to have
driven upwards of 3000 persons to seek bread in a foreign
land.&nbsp; The woollen trade of Norwich, which had been created
by the Flemish refugees, was <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>mostly in the hands of the Puritans,
and the rigorous measures of this prelate nearly destroyed it by
banishing them.</p>
<p>Mr. W. Bridge, M.A., was the lecturer of St. George Tombland,
Norwich, up to the year 1637.&nbsp; He was a pious and learned
man, who held other livings and performed his duties well.&nbsp;
To him, on a certain day, came Bishop Wren&rsquo;s order to read
the &ldquo;Book of Sports&rdquo; on the next Sunday in
church.&nbsp; He sat in dejection, with the odious volume before
him, abhorring the profaneness of its contents and its daring
contradiction of Scripture.&nbsp; He resolved not to read
it.&nbsp; He took counsel of his brethren, and several of them
together refused compliance, fled to Yarmouth, and thence with
sad hearts embarked for Holland, where they spent many anxious
years, hoping to be allowed to return.&nbsp; Laud informed King
Charles I. that Bridge had left two livings and a lectureship and
had fled to Holland; and the king wrote against his name this
bitter sentence: &ldquo;<i>We are well rid of
him</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was an expression worthy of a bigoted
and worldly mind.&nbsp; Thus it appears that the reformation was
not the work of kings or bishops, or the great and learned.&nbsp;
The history of those times is the history of persecuting power in
opposition to the progress of the Gospel&mdash;an opposition the
more dreadful inasmuch as it was carried on under the pretence of
doing service to religion.</p>
<p>The Reformed Church of England acknowledged the right of
private judgment in theory, but ignored it in practice.&nbsp; The
Puritans, on the other hand, carried <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>it out to its legitimate
consequences; and Milton, their great champion, advocated
absolute freedom of thought and speech as the birthright of every
man.&nbsp; No doubt Puritanism ran into some excesses of bigotry
and intolerance, but it was an intolerant age.&nbsp; Puritanism,
however, preserved civil and religious liberty and the right of
private judgment, and perpetuated that right to all sects and
classes of the nation.&nbsp; Puritanism has been charged with the
sin of schism, but the early reformers were forced into it by
persecution for conscientious scruples respecting points of
doctrine and discipline.&nbsp; William Bridge, Asty, Allen,
Cromwell, and Fynch, all were thrown out of their livings by the
Act of Uniformity, and became Nonconformist ministers in
Norwich.&nbsp; Without any conference the question put to them
was, &ldquo;<i>Will you upon oath conform</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
answer was, &ldquo;We cannot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Immediate expulsion
followed.&nbsp; Where, then, was the sin of schism?&nbsp; Their
sin would have been in conformity.&nbsp; They would have proved
to the world that they were mere hirelings, like the &ldquo;Vicar
of Bray,&rdquo; who changed his religion to please the reigning
sovereign of the day.&nbsp; Bridge, returning with some others to
his native county, founded the first Independent church at
Yarmouth about 1642.&nbsp; A year later the church at Norwich was
formed into a distinct body.&nbsp; They met at first in a
brew-house in St. Edmund&rsquo;s, afterwards in the refectory
over the cloisters in the convent formerly belonging to the Black
Friars.</p>
<h4><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span><span class="smcap">The Independents</span>.</h4>
<p>We shall now briefly advert to the rise of the Nonconformist
religious denominations in this city, and quote a passage from a
discourse by the Rev. A. Reed, delivered at the Old Meeting
House, Norwich, on February 27th, 1842, on the occasion of the
second centenary.&nbsp; He said,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that in or about 1641
many refugees returned to their homes in Norwich, Yarmouth, and
other places.&nbsp; Those who returned to the two former
localities had been united together in fellowship with the church
at Rotterdam.&nbsp; They earnestly desired that, as they had been
companions in suffering, they might not cease to form one
church.&nbsp; The difficulty was where to fix the joint
society.&nbsp; Norwich offered liberty and opportunity.&nbsp; But
the proximity of Yarmouth to the sea was desirable for
safety.&nbsp; Early in 1642 they met, probably in Norwich, to
discuss the point; and agreed to send to Rotterdam for leave to
gather in fellowship here.&nbsp; The assent reached them in the
autumn, authorizing them to form a church at Norwich or other
place.&nbsp; On November 23rd, 1642, they met to form a
church.&nbsp; Most of the members&rsquo; names, twelve in all, we
find afterwards attached to the Norwich covenant.&nbsp; They did
not settle the question of place at this meeting.&nbsp; The
Yarmouth church book records a resolution to fix the church at
Norwich for the present.&nbsp; They met again for this purpose,
and the brethren at Norwich, out of an earnest desire to finish
the work of incorporating a church, yielded that the church
meetings (i.e. ordinances and meetings for admission of members)
should be for the <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>present at Yarmouth.&nbsp; The church was to settle
with all convenient speed where most liberty and opportunity
appeared, and wherever the increase of the church was greatest;
but none of them were required to remove their habitations at
present.&nbsp; Soon after this agreement, however, the Norwich
brethren find these concessions too inconvenient; they beg that
the church may be settled at Norwich, and that the Yarmouth
people would remove to the city.&nbsp; At length they consent
reluctantly to part company, and a separate church is formed at
Norwich.&nbsp; But the materials for the society already existed,
and owing to these facts, the early date of 1642 appears to me to
belong as much to us as to our sister society at
Yarmouth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The records of the congregational church at Beccles contain
information of much historic value to all the congregational
churches in Norwich, Norfolk, and Suffolk, and from those records
the following particulars are derived.&nbsp; On June 10th, 1644,
the Church at Norwich in the Old Meeting House was regularly
formed.&nbsp; Mr. Oxenbridge, assistant pastor at Yarmouth, and
several of the Yarmouth brethren were present, when the covenant
was adopted and signed afresh.&nbsp; On July 26th, 1647, Mr.
Timothy Armitage was unanimously chosen pastor.&nbsp; The members
were 32 in number.</p>
<p>After the death of Mr. Armitage, in 1655, Mr. Thomas Allen,
M.A., gave up the station he held of &ldquo;Preacher to the
City&rdquo; in January, 1656, to become pastor of the Old
Meeting.&nbsp; During his long ministry of 17 years, the cause
continued to flourish, the congregation being large.&nbsp; He
died September 21, 1673.</p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>On
October 9th, 1675, Mr. John Cromwell was ordained pastor, and Mr.
Robert Asty an assistant pastor.&nbsp; Mr. Asty was an ejected
minister of Suffolk, an author, and a useful, devout
preacher.&nbsp; Still the church grew, and was the centre of much
good to the city and county, for many congregations were
established in Norfolk and Suffolk, at Wymondham, North Walsham,
Guestwick, Tunstead, Stalham, Edgefield, and other places.</p>
<p>Then followed, about 1685, Mr. Martin Fynch, who was an
ejected clergyman of Totney, in Lincolnshire.&nbsp; An elaborate
inscription yet remains on his tombstone, to record his worth and
usefulness.&nbsp; He was carried to his grave on the shoulders of
his deacons, amidst great lamentations of the whole church and
congregation.&nbsp; About two or three years before his death, a
handsome and spacious brick edifice was erected, which is the
present Old Meeting House.&nbsp; In 1688, the Revolution promoted
the cause of religious liberty.&nbsp; Many distinguished
residents in the city now joined the nonconformists, and the
resources of the society were increased by endowments left for
the benefit of the poor, and other purposes.</p>
<p>Mr. John Stackhouse succeeded Mr. Fynch in 1690, and continued
pastor for 17 years.&nbsp; Towards the close of his pastorate,
the church began to suffer from its altered circumstances.&nbsp;
It had become far too worldly for its spiritual welfare.&nbsp;
The bonds of unity, so long preserved by Christian charity, grew
weak.&nbsp; The members divided in reference to the choice of a
co-pastor, and the dispute ran so high, that the minister <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>and most of
the congregation were actually driven out of their place of
worship, and were obliged to fit up a meeting house in the ruins
of the Black Friars&rsquo; convent.&nbsp; Mr. Stackhouse died
without witnessing a reconciliation between the mutually offended
parties.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Scott left the pastorate of the church of Hitchin,
in Herts, and settled in Norwich in 1709.&nbsp; The two parties
were reconciled under his ministry, and he returned to the Old
Meeting House about 1717, under very favorable auspices.&nbsp;
His son, Mr. Nichol Scott, became his assistant, and a most
unhappy difference on a point of doctrine once more kindled the
flame of discord.&nbsp; The son was dismissed in 1737, and
numbers of his hearers left with him.&nbsp; For a time he
lectured in the French Church, but finding little encouragement,
he became a doctor of physic, and practised in the city.&nbsp;
The father&rsquo;s mind was so shattered by the dispute, that he
became almost unfit for ministerial work.&nbsp; He died in
1746.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott was, in his latter years, assisted by Mr. Abraham
Tozer, who now succeeded to the charge at Norwich.&nbsp; Dr.
Doddridge assisted at his ordination, and Mr. Samuel Wood was
chosen co-pastor with Mr. Tozer.&nbsp; On the removal of the
latter to Exeter, Mr. Wood, afterwards Dr. Wood, held the
pastoral office for twenty years.&nbsp; The church enjoyed, under
his care, a season of prosperity and peace, and the meeting house
was densely crowded.&nbsp; He died, November 2nd, 1767, much
lamented.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Newton, who had been assistant preacher, was
ordained pastor February 16th, 1768, <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>and continued in the office
fifty-six years.&nbsp; He gave the second list of the whole
number of members, which had increased to 108.&nbsp; He had five
assistants in succession.&nbsp; Mr. Hull was the last assistant,
and on the death of Mr. Newton, June 29th, 1809, succeeded him in
the pastoral office.&nbsp; The number of members increased to 112
in 1811, and to 156 in 1820.&nbsp; Mr. Hull officiated fourteen
years, and then resigned in consequence of a disagreement with
the deacons.&nbsp; He became a church clergyman and perpetual
curate of St. Gregory&rsquo;s in this city.</p>
<p>The Rev. Stephen Morell removed from Exeter and was chosen
pastor in June 17th, 1824, and he died in October of the same
year.&nbsp; The church next invited the services of the Rev. J.
B. Innes, of Weymouth, in 1825, and being chosen pastor, he
continued in the office twelve years.&nbsp; He died in April,
1837.&nbsp; He was greatly beloved by his personal friends, and
his character and talents were held in general esteem.</p>
<p>The vacant office was next filled by the Rev. J. H. Godwin,
who was ordained to it on December 6th, 1837.&nbsp; After
fulfilling the pastoral duties for two years, he became resident
tutor of Highbury College.&nbsp; The Rev. A. Reed was then
invited to fill the office, and became pastor over a church of
190 members.&nbsp; He continued till 1855, and then removed to a
wider sphere of labour.&nbsp; The Rev. John Hallett was invited
in the following year, and is now the esteemed minister of the
church.&nbsp; Mr. Hallett, in a recent contribution to the pages
of the <i>Evangelical Magazine</i> on the history of the Old
Meeting House, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>&ldquo;The Rev. A. Reed, B.A., now of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s, was Mr. Godwin&rsquo;s successor till
1855.&nbsp; Under his superintendence, bicentenary services,
commemorating the foundation of the church, were held, which,
judging from published and oral reports, must have been of a
stirring and deeply interesting character.&nbsp; Spacious
school-rooms were erected, and large day-schools
established.&nbsp; Many still live in our midst who gratefully
attest the faithfulness and success of Mr. Reed&rsquo;s
pastorate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In April, 1856, the writer was, he believes, divinely
led to occupy the vacant post.&nbsp; For obvious reasons, the
history of the last twelve years must remain untold.&nbsp; It
may, however, be stated that the present pastor, like his
predecessor, has had the privilege of celebrating a
bicentenary.&nbsp; For reasons before assigned, it will probably
be conceded that nowhere was it more proper that a bicentenary
commemoration of the ejectment of 1662 should be held than in
this Old Meeting House, and that a more fitting way of
commemorating it could not be devised than that of enfranchising
the building in which some of them laboured, and the
&lsquo;yard&rsquo; in which they sleep.&nbsp; This was
accordingly done.&nbsp; The premises, which were leasehold, and
the lease of which was nearly expired, were purchased and
repaired at a large outlay, and then put in trust for the
denomination.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thus, for nearly two centuries, has
the Lord preserved to Himself a worshipping people in this
place.&nbsp; Thousands have found this ancient sanctuary the very
&lsquo;House of God,&rsquo; and, literally, &lsquo;the gate of
Heaven,&rsquo; and are now enjoying the full glory they
anticipated here.&nbsp; And,&rsquo; adds my predecessor, with a
thankfulness and faith in which I fully share, &lsquo;still the
waters flow strong and deep, and the banks are green with
promise, and through future ages the brook shall not be dried up,
but with purer, wider, stronger, and more <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>fertilizing
current, shall form one of those millennial streams wherewith the
whole earth shall be watered as a fruitful garden of the
Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Baptists</span>.</h4>
<p>Mr. Martin Hood Wilkin, in his life of Joseph Kinghorn, gives
the following account of the origin of the Baptist
denomination.&nbsp; A General (Arminian) Baptist Church was
formed in Norwich in 1686 by the learned and zealous Thomas
Grantham.&nbsp; They purchased a part of the White Friars&rsquo;
Priory in St. James&rsquo;s, on the site of which they built the
Meeting House now known as the Priory Yard Chapel.&nbsp; From
this Church several members separated at a very early period and
formed the Particular (Calvinistic) Baptist Church, over which
Mr. Kinghorn afterwards presided.&nbsp; Of its history he has
left a somewhat elaborate sketch in the notes of the last sermon
he preached in the Meeting House, in St. Mary&rsquo;s, before it
was taken down in 1811.&nbsp; He says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of the origin of this Church I find no
record.&nbsp; The first date in our old Church book is
1691.&nbsp; In 1693, we find an account of admonition given to a
brother who had, &lsquo;for several years past,&rsquo; withdrawn
himself from the Communion of the Church. * * * I find a
statement of the sentiments of the Church in that time, entitled,
&lsquo;The several articles of our faith, in which with one
accord we agree.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of the state of the Church I can
say but little.&nbsp; A list of 55 members follows, which appears
to have been the number at that time.&nbsp; Of their minister I
can say still less, except <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>that the second and third articles
in the book are drawn up with that precision which marks the
junction of talent and education, especially at a time when few
had any claim to the advantages of a classical education.&nbsp;
One of these is signed &lsquo;Edward Williams, pastor.&rsquo; * *
* * At this time our ancestors met for the worship of God in the
&lsquo;Granary,&rsquo; in St. Michael&rsquo;s Coslany.&nbsp;
Their baptisms were performed in the river.&nbsp; At one period,
a friend had premises convenient, and in the memory of some now
alive, they were used for that purpose; but such is the effect of
habit, that the prejudice in favour of a mode so primitive
continued some time after better conveniences were
obtained.&nbsp; From this period nothing of importance is to be
discovered till 1745.&nbsp; Then the premises which stood on this
spot were purchased and the Meeting (house) was erected, which
was nearly two-thirds the size of the present building.&nbsp;
When it was finished I do not find, but from a private record I
am informed, that Mr. Lindoe, who for many years was an
honourable and valued deacon, was the first person baptised in
this house, and this was on March 15th, 1746.&nbsp; From this
period, for some time, the Church seems to have worn a
flourishing appearance on the whole.&nbsp; They had a minister,
Mr. John Stearne, who was evidently a superior man.&nbsp; He died
in July, 1755.&nbsp; Rev. George Simson, M.A., from Cambridge,
accepted a call from Mr. Stearne&rsquo;s Church, went to Norwich,
in 1758, continued there two or three years, and then removed to
Warwick, where he had formerly been pastor, and where, weighed
down by age and infirmities, he died suddenly in 1763.&nbsp;
After this period there was an evident decline for some years,
though to what extent I am not able to say.&nbsp; Afterwards
there was an appearance of prosperity.&nbsp; In 1766 I find a
list of members again, amounting to 59, the largest number
hitherto met with, but alas! after that period, there <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>was much to
be lamented.&nbsp; There was the evil conduct of some, and a
spirit of division in others, which all tended to mischief. * * *
* But we are now approaching a period within the remembrance of
many of you, in which it will be useless to attempt to trace the
history of events which you know.&nbsp; Suffice it then, to say
that causes already mentioned brought the Church and congregation
down to a very low ebb, when Mr. David, whose name I have heard
so many of you repeat with esteem and affection, first came
here.&nbsp; On his ordination, the list of members that appeared
in the Church book, and which included all the members as they
stood at that time, was only 31; and now events took a
turn.&nbsp; The short period of his life was distinguished by its
utility.&nbsp; The Meeting House became too small for the
congregation, and in 1783, it was enlarged to its present
size.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is Mr. Kinghorn&rsquo;s account (condensed) of the early
Baptist Churches.&nbsp; After a visit to the North, he returned
to Norwich in July, 1789, and then commenced the long career of
his ministry at St. Mary&rsquo;s Chapel, though the invitation to
the pastoral office was not received till some months
afterwards.&nbsp; He rigidly adhered to what is called
&ldquo;strict communion&rdquo; in his Church, admitting only
those who had been immersed to the Lord&rsquo;s supper; and on
this point he maintained a long controversy with Mr. Robert Hall,
of Bristol, who advocated &ldquo;free communion&rdquo; with all
believers in a Work published in 1815.&nbsp; The Rev. J. Kinghorn
was much esteemed by his numerous friends, including Mrs. Opie,
J. J. Gurney, Esq., Rev. J. Alexander, Bishop Bathurst, Mr. W.
Wilkin, Mr. W. Taylor, and others, of Norwich, and many more men
of learning <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>all over the country.&nbsp; He took rank among the
Nonconformists with Mr. R. Hall of Bristol, Mr. Foster, the
author of <i>Essays on Decision of Character</i>, Mr. Innes, and
Mr. James A. Haldane, of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The following <span class="smcap">Tributary Lines</span> are
by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Opie</span>, on hearing it said that
J. Kinghorn &ldquo;was fit to die.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hail! words of truth, that Christian
comfort give!<br />
But then the &lsquo;fit to die,&rsquo; how fit to live!<br />
To live a bright example to mankind,<br />
&lsquo;Feet to the lame and eyesight to the blind!&rsquo;<br />
To lift the lamp, the word of God, on high;<br />
To point to Calvary&rsquo;s mount the sinner&rsquo;s eye;<br />
To tread the path the first Apostles trod,<br />
And earn that precious name, &lsquo;a man of God.&rsquo;<br />
He lived whom Christian hearts deplore,<br />
And hence the grief&mdash;he lives for us no more.<br />
But faith exulting joins the general cry,<br />
He, fit to live, was greatly fit to die!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Kinghorn was succeeded by the Rev. W. Brock, who was the
esteemed pastor for many years, and is now the minister of
Bloomsbury Chapel, London.&nbsp; He was followed by the present
minister, the Rev. G. Gould.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Calvinistic Methodists in Norwich seem to have been
originated by Mr. James Wheatley, who came to the city about
1750, and preached at first in the open-air, on Tombland and the
Castle Hill.&nbsp; Great excitement was produced, and a temporary
building was soon erected, and called the Tabernacle.&nbsp; The
site has been changed, but the name is still retained.&nbsp; The
present Tabernacle was built in 1784.</p>
<p><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>The
Wesleyan Methodists first appeared in Norwich in 1754, when the
Revs. John and Charles Wesley visited the city, and the Rev. J.
Wesley preached here for some time, and on leaving, appointed Mr.
T. Oliver in his room.&nbsp; One of his successors was the Rev.
R. Robinson, afterwards at Cambridge, who also preached for some
time at the Tabernacle; and another was Dr. Adam Clarke, the
learned Commentator, who was appointed in 1783, but left in
1785.&nbsp; Their first chapel was built in 1769, in Cherry
Lane.</p>

258</span>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
Social State of the City from the Fourteenth to the Eighteenth
Centuries.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> we proceed to chronicle the
leading local events of the 18th century, it may not be
altogether unprofitable to review briefly the social state of the
city during some 300 or 400 years preceding.&nbsp; In doing this
we may now and then have to advert to matters to which we have
alluded already; but at the risk even of an occasional
repetition, it will be worth while&mdash;in order to help our
readers to appreciate subsequent improvements at their proper
worth&mdash;to consider a little more minutely than we have yet
done, the physical circumstances under which the citizens have
lived in former centuries, and the various influences to which
they have been subject.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Chapter of Horrors&rdquo; might be written,
descriptive of the plagues, pestilences, famines, floods, and
fires, which devastated the city and county for 300 <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>years.&nbsp; It would seem as if the darkness and gloom
of the physical world corresponded at times with the
superstitions and vices of the people.&nbsp; The dark ages were
ages of terrible calamities, and England was then a terrible
country to live in.&nbsp; Plagues and pestilences now and again
desolated the whole land, and Norfolk and Norwich did not escape
the ravages of diseases emphatically named the &ldquo;Black
Death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Exaggerated accounts must have been given of
the desolations caused by these various scourges, or else both
city and county must have more than once lost the great part of
their inhabitants.</p>
<p>Blomefield is responsible for very dark pictures indeed; but
his statements, right or wrong, have been endorsed by later
compilers of local history.&nbsp; We are told, by one writer, for
instance, that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In 1348, the plague, which had lately
ravaged the greatest part of the known world, broke out in this
city; wherein there died, according to the most credible
accounts, within the space of twelve months, upwards of 57,000
persons, besides religious and beggars; and this will not appear
very surprising, when we consider that in some places not
one-fifth part of the people were left alive, and that Norwich
was more populous at that time than it has ever been since.&nbsp;
It then contained sixty churches, besides conventual ones, within
the walls; and the large parishes of Heigham and Pockthorpe, and
the large chapel of St. Mary Magdalene without them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the astounding statement in a local history printed by
John Crouse, in 1768.&nbsp; Where he got his <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>&ldquo;credible accounts&rdquo; he does not say, and he
moreover gives the statement of the Domesday Book, that in 1086,
the city contained only 1565 burgesses; so that the population
must have increased in 250 years to a most fabulous extent, for
57,000 persons to have died of the plague in 1348.&nbsp; In 1377,
a census was taken of some large towns, and Norwich was then
found to contain 5300 people.&nbsp; But in truth the number,
57,000, very probably applied to the whole diocese, for the same
local history states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This severe visitation was not confined to
the city alone, but cruelly extended itself all over the diocese;
so that in many monasteries and religious houses, there were
scarce two out of twenty left alive.&nbsp; From the register book
it appears that in the course of the year there were 863
institutions.&nbsp; The clergy dying so fast, that they were
obliged to induct into livings numbers of youths who had but just
received the tonsure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The register in question was, no doubt, one of the whole
diocese.</p>
<p>In 1361 there happened a great dearth, attended by the plague;
this was called the second pestilence.&nbsp; And on January 15th,
in the same year, there arose so furious a storm of wind from the
south west, as to throw down the tower of the cathedral, which
falling on the choir demolished a great part of it.&nbsp; The
storm raged violently for six or seven days, and was succeeded by
a prodigious fall of rain, which occasioned incredible damage by
inundations.&nbsp; Where the inundations occurred is not stated
in the local history, <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>but if in the city the damage must
have been great indeed.</p>
<p>In 1369, the plague broke out afresh and carried off great
numbers of people very suddenly.&nbsp; Yet in 1371, the citizens
were commanded to furnish the king with a good barge,
sufficiently equipped for war to serve against his enemies, the
French and Spaniards.&nbsp; This does not indicate that the city
had been almost depopulated only a few years before.&nbsp;
Indeed, during all this time the citizens had been doing their
best by legal contests to hinder Yarmouth being made a staple
town, though they did not succeed.</p>
<p>About 1390 a great mortality broke out in the city, occasioned
by the people eating unwholesome food; and this not so much from
a scarcity of corn as of money to purchase it.&nbsp; The plague
raged greatly in Norfolk and in many other counties, and was
nearly equal in severity to the first great pestilence.&nbsp; So
states the local narrative which we have just quoted; and yet,
according to the census of 1377, as already stated, the
population was only 5300!&nbsp; What reliance then can be placed
on such accounts?&nbsp; The calamities recorded were, no doubt,
sufficiently awful without the aid of exaggeration.</p>
<p>In 1578, the plague again broke out, and continued to rage
nearly two years; destroying 2335 natives and 2482
strangers.&nbsp; During the infection, it was ordered that every
person coming from an infected house, should carry in his hand a
small wand two feet in length; and that no such person should
appear at any court or public place, or be present at any <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>sermon; and
that the inscription, &ldquo;Lord have mercy on us,&rdquo; should
be placed over the door of every infected house, and there remain
until the house had been clear of the infection for one month at
least.</p>
<p>In 1583, the plague broke out once more, and 800 or 900
persons died of it, chiefly &ldquo;strangers;&rdquo; and in 1588,
the same disease again raged in the city, but not very
violently.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all these awful visitations, no
proper sanitary measures appear to have been adopted.</p>
<p>In 1593, there happened so great a drought, that many cattle
perished for want of water; but it is stated that in the year
following it scarcely ceased raining, day or night, from June
21st to the end of July.</p>
<p>In 1602, the plague again raged with almost unprecedented
fury, there dying thereof 30,578 in London, and 3076 in
Norwich.&nbsp; This visitation, moreover, was attended with so
great a scarcity, that wheat sold for ten, rye for six, and
barley for five shillings a bushel&mdash;a very high price in
those days; and the poor in the city must then have been in a
dreadful state of destitution.&nbsp; Again, in the summer of
1609, the city was visited by its former scourge, though but few
died of it.&nbsp; The mayor received a letter from the privy
council to keep up the ancient strictness and severity of lent,
as if the poor had not fasted long enough!</p>
<p>In 1625, we find that something like sanitary measures were
begun.&nbsp; On July 12th of that year, the mayor received a
commission authorising the body <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>corporate to levy a tax on all the
inhabitants, to be applied towards scouring the ditches, and the
removal of all nuisances in and about the city, the better to
prevent the spreading of the plague which had lately broken out
in Yarmouth, having been occasioned by the arrival there of some
infected persons.&nbsp; These precautions not having the desired
effect, the Black Tower, then on Butter Hills, was fitted up for
the reception of the afflicted poor.&nbsp; In September, about 40
died in a week, and the plague raged till May, 1626, when it
began to abate.&nbsp; As many as 1431 persons died while the
disease continued.</p>
<p>In 1646, the plague again made its appearance in Norwich, but
its effects were not very fatal.&nbsp; In 1665, however, it broke
out once more, and made dreadful ravages; carrying off 2251
persons.&nbsp; During its continuance, at the instance of the
County Magistrates, the Market was held in the Town Close, and
the City was not quite cleared of the disease till the end of
1667.&nbsp; The Bishop then ordered September 19th to be observed
as a day of general thanksgiving to God for His great mercy in
putting a stop to the pestilence.&nbsp; All quite right and
proper, but had there been more cleansing as well as praying, the
city might not have suffered so severely.&nbsp; The Corporation
had utterly and entirely ignored its chief duty in regard to all
sanitary rules and regulations.&nbsp; There was scarcely an
apology for a system of drainage, and never a sufficient supply
of water.&nbsp; The poor people were cooped up in narrow yards,
courts, and streets, and, on account of high prices, could seldom
obtain wholesome food.&nbsp; They <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>had a terrible revenge in these
direful plagues, which destroyed the rich in their fine houses,
as well as the poor in their hovels.</p>
<p>Some idea of the social state of the city during this period
may be formed from a few gleanings from the City Records, from
which it will appear, that from the 14th till the 18th century,
though the authorities neglected to improve the sanitary
condition of the city, they took great care to protect the people
from frauds of brewers, traders, and manufacturers, who were at
least strongly suspected of being addicted to dishonest
practices.&nbsp; Mr. R. Fitch, of this city, has published some
interesting notices of &ldquo;Brewers&rsquo; Marks and Trade
Regulations.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are of great historical interest,
and we therefore make no apology to our readers for reproducing
the following extracts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Scarcely a trade was exempt from these
regulations, some of which were attended with espionage so
peculiar and strict as to lead us to wonder why public opinion,
although in those days admittedly weak, was not so far aroused
as, by its own voice, to free the community from some of the
petty, if not the heavier restrictions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brewers, we discover, had especial symbols of their
own, which they registered when licensed to follow their
occupations, and it was also found that these marks were borne by
successive followers of the same trade, until the business of
succeeding firms became extinguished by the death or retirement
of the last of a long line of brewers, and then only did the
particular symbol fall into disuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the year 1606 to 1725, no less than fifty separate
marks have been found in the City of Norwich, some of <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>them being
borne as symbolical of a particular brew-house, by eight or nine
persons, who followed each other in one and the same
occupation.&nbsp; These marks were noted in a variety of
documents, belonging to the Corporation, one preserved in their
muniment room.&nbsp; They appeared, for instance, in a
&lsquo;Brewer&rsquo;s book,&rsquo; or the book of the
&lsquo;Clarke of the Market,&rsquo; and in books recording the
proceeding of city courts and assemblies.&nbsp; The following
extracts taken from the &lsquo;Brewers&rsquo; Book&rsquo; relate
to the government of all brewers&rsquo; houses and tippling
houses, fully bearing out the opinion previously expressed as
regards the strictness of the laws by which such places were
regulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The enquirie for Brewers to ye Booke of ye
Clarke of ye Market, and is taken out of his booke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Items, to be enquired of Ale brewers; whether
they brewe their ale of anie maner of fustie, dustie, or wealved
maulte, mixed or mingled with any hoppes, roson, chalke, or any
other noisome or unwholesome corn or liquor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And yt they make noe rawe ale or long roping
ale, keeping their Ale fixed, yt is to say, twelve pence highning
and twelve pence lowning in a quarter of maulte.&nbsp; For when
ye mace buy a quart of maulte for two shillings, then ye may sell
a gallon of ye best ale for an halfe penny; three shillings,
three farthings; foure shillings, foure farthings; five
shillings, five farthings; six shillings, six farthings; seven
shillings, seven farthings; eight shillings, eight farthings;
nine shillings, nine farthings; and so forth and no further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And to sell a quarte of the best ale for a halfe
penny, with measures true sized, and sealed according to the
King&rsquo;s standard, and doing the contrarie to be
punished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus it appears that brewing was a very ancient
business in this city in the 16th century, and the best ale was
sold for a half penny per quart before the iniquitous malt-tax
was imposed.</p>
<p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>&ldquo;The following are extracts from the statutes,
&amp;c.</p>

hence forth occupie ye misterie or craft of coupers, no make any
barrells, &amp;c., wherein they shall put their beer or
ale.&nbsp; Penalty 3d. 4d. for every vessell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Every vessell to be made of seasonable wood, and
marked with ye coupers&rsquo; mark, ye contents of every vessell

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Coupers not to inhance ye prices of vessells,
but keepe this rate, on forfeit of 3d. 4d. for every vessell,
defective or enhanced, viz. Barrell for beer, ix<sup>d.</sup>;
Kynderkyn, v<sup>d.</sup>; Ferkyn, iij<sup>d.</sup>; Ale Barrell,
xvj<sup>d.</sup>; Kynderkyn, ix<sup>d.</sup>; Ferkyn,
v<sup>d.</sup>&nbsp; Brewers not to put Beer or Ale to sale but
in Barrells, &amp;c., conteyning as above said.&nbsp; And to sell
at such prices as affixed by ye Justices of ye Peace of ye
County, or Maior, Sheriff, or other head officers of City,
Borough, and Town Corporate, under forfeiture as above, under
Beere brewers out of Clarke of Markets book, half to ye king, and
half to him who will sue.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt other traders, as well as brewers and keepers
of tippling houses, were regulated by corresponding laws.&nbsp;
Indeed this appears from the records and orders in the books of
the corporate assembly.&nbsp; In the 8th year of Edward IV., the
mayor issued an order in the name of the king, that brewers were
not to sell yeast, but to give it away to whoever wanted it, as
it had been freely given away time out of mind.&nbsp; By the 4th
and 5th of Philip and Mary, it was enacted
that:&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bere bruer to brewe nor sell to any typpler, or
other person, any bere called doble doble bere, but only two
sorts of bere, viz., best bere and small bere, upon forfeit of ye
beer and cask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the Brewers&rsquo; Assembly book, 30th
July, 1657, the brewers agreed, by reason of 2/6 excise per
barrel, that they would not sell any strong beer to any ale-house
<a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>keeper,
under 12/- per barrel of beer, and excise.&nbsp; It was also
agreed in August, 1657, that ale-house keepers might sell one
wine quart of strong beer for a penny.&nbsp; There were three
sorts of beer of different prices, viz., 4/-, 6/-, and 10/- per
barrel, beside excise.&nbsp; The brewers of beer petitioned
strongly against the tax of 2/6 per barrel, as a great hardship
and injustice.&nbsp; The names of 40 brewers are recorded in this
city, from 1600 to 1725.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brewers&rsquo; marks are entered as early as 1606, and
as late as 1725.&nbsp; The mark, No. 1, John Boyce, was first
borne by Henry Woodes, in 1606, and after him by five successive
brewers, ending with this John Boyce, in 1725.&nbsp; As yet, the
regulations relating to trade marks generally are very
imperfectly known, leaving a wide field of research to those who
desire further information.&nbsp; The same marks passed from one
brewer to his successors, and they were held in all their
integrity, till within a century and a half of our own
time.&nbsp; It would be an important contribution to local
history, if all the rules relating to trade could be collected
and elucidated.&rdquo;</p>

268</span>CHAPTER XV.<br />
Norwich in the Eighteenth Century.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Reformation had now become an
established fact in the Churches of England and Scotland; the
glorious Revolution of 1688 had been accomplished; the civil wars
were over, and the country enjoyed a long period of repose.&nbsp;
Local events had, it is true, become of less importance, because
less connected with general history; but the narrative will not
be the less interesting to local readers.&nbsp; Walls and gates
still surrounded the old city, and confined it within narrow
limits.&nbsp; All the principal streets within the walls were now
built.&nbsp; The population had increased to 28,000, the working
classes being chiefly employed in textile manufactures, which
were in great demand all over Europe.&nbsp; The operatives were
well employed and well paid during the greater part of this
century.&nbsp; It was, in short, a flourishing period in the
history of Norwich, as regards its manufactures and its
trade.</p>
<p>Queen Anne was proclaimed here on March 12th, 1701, and was
crowned on April 3rd, 1702, with extraordinary exhibitions of
joy.&nbsp; In this year, too, <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>the art of printing, which had been
for some time discontinued here, was revived, and Francis Burgess
soon afterwards opened a printing office near the Red Well.&nbsp;
In 1701, the first newspaper, called the Norwich Gazette, was
published by Henry Cosgrove, he being assisted in the undertaking
by the celebrated Edward Cave, the original planner and founder
of the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, which was first
published in 1731.&nbsp; The Gazette was subsequently enlarged,
and called the <i>Norfolk Chronicle and Norwich Gazette</i>,
published by Messrs. Stevenson and Matchett.&nbsp; The former
gentleman was a learned antiquarian, and published &ldquo;The
Antiquities of Ely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1705, the Weavers&rsquo; Hall was broken open, and the
books were destroyed, since which time the custom of sealing
stuffs has been disused.&nbsp; What was the cause of the tumult
does not appear.</p>
<p>In 1706, a great part of the city was laid under water by two
violent floods, both of which happened in the month of
November.</p>
<p>In 1711, the first act was passed for erecting workhouses,
&amp;c., in this city; by which it was provided&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That from and after the first day of May,
1712, there shall be a corporation to continue for ever, within
the said city of Norwich and county of the same, and liberties
thereof, consisting of mayor, recorder, and steward, justices of
the peace, sheriffs, and aldermen of the said city for the time
being, and of thirty-two other persons of the most honest,
discreet, and charitable inhabitants of the said city and county,
in the four great wards of the said city, and the towns, and out
parishes in the county of the said city, in <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>such manner
as is hereinafter expressed, and the said thirty-two persons
shall be elected on the third day of May next ensuing, or within
three days after, at an assembly of the said city, for that
purpose to be held, by the votes of the mayor, sheriffs,
citizens, and commonalty, in common council assembled, or of the
major part of them present.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follow the provisions of the act by which all the
parishes in the city were incorporated for the relief of the
poor.&nbsp; The Court of Guardians was constituted, and empowered
to assess to the poor rates all lands, houses, tenements, tithes,
stock, and personal estates.&nbsp; The assessment of stock and
personal estate, as may be easily imagined, caused great
dissatisfaction amongst the rate-payers possessed of property,
and was abolished in 1827, when a new act was obtained which
considerably altered the constitution of the court.&nbsp; This
act was further amended by another passed in 1831, and that was
superseded in 1863, by the act at this time in force.</p>
<p>In 1712, the steeple of the new Hall, now St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall, fell down and was never rebuilt.</p>
<p>In 1713, the Duke of Ormond was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of
Norfolk and Norwich, in the room of Lord Townshend.</p>
<p>George I. was proclaimed here on the 3rd of August, 1714, two
days after Queen Anne died.</p>
<p>In 1714 a Bethel was built for the reception of poor lunatics
by Mrs. Mary Chapman&mdash;one of the first charitable
foundations in this country for those unhappy persons.&nbsp; In
1717 she endowed the same by her will, in which is the following
pious clause:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>&ldquo;Whereas it has pleased Almighty God to visit and
afflict some of my nearest relations with lunacy, but has blessed
me with the use of my reason and understanding; as a monument of
my thankfulnesss for this invaluable mercy, I settle Bethel,
&amp;c., for this purpose.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was the widow of the Rev. Mr. Chapman, minister of St.
Lawrence.</p>
<p>In 1715, in consequence of the rebellion in the north, an
artillery company of 100 men was first raised in Norwich.&nbsp;
William Hall, Esq., was their captain.</p>
<p>On January 8th of the same year, Sir Peter Seaman, an
Alderman, died and left provision for binding out two poor city
boys yearly.&nbsp; On December 17th of the same year, Thomas
Hall, Esq., merchant, died.&nbsp; He founded a monthly
sacramental lecture; bequeathed several legacies to charities,
and left &pound;100 for a gold chain to be worn by the Mayor of
Norwich, and which is the same as is now worn by the deputy
mayor.&nbsp; It weighs 23 ozs. 6 dwts.&nbsp; Mr. Hall was
interred with great funeral pomp at St. George&rsquo;s
Colegate.&nbsp; His portrait was presented by John and Edward
Taylor, Esqs., to the corporation, and was placed in the common
council chamber, May, 1821.</p>
<p>An act was passed in 1722 for the better qualifying of the
manufacturers of stuffs and yarns to act as magistrates, and for
regulating the elections of such officers.</p>
<p>About this time another act was passed for clearing,
deepening, extending, maintaining, and improving the <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>haven and
piers of Great Yarmouth, and for deepening the rivers flowing
into the harbour; and also for preserving ships wintering in the
haven from accidents by fire.&nbsp; For these purposes certain
duties were to be paid for 21 years after Lady day, 1723, on all
goods unladen in the haven of Yarmouth, or in the sea called
Yarmouth roads.&nbsp; This act was very important to the
navigation between Yarmouth and Norwich.</p>
<p>In 1724 the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office was rebuilt, and the statue
of Justice placed on the Guildhall.&nbsp; Alderman Norman died
the same year, and left an estate in Norwich for charitable
purposes.</p>
<p>About this time the society of &ldquo;Free and Accepted
Masons&rdquo; appeared publicly in this city.&nbsp; Mr. Prideaux,
son of the Rev. Dr. Prideaux, Dean of Norwich, author of
&ldquo;The Connection between the Old and New Testaments,&rdquo;
was the first Master here.&nbsp; Their lodge was at the
Maid&rsquo;s Head Inn.&nbsp; B. Bond Cabbell, Esq., has within
the last few years bought the old Assembly Rooms in Theatre
Street for the Order.</p>
<p>On September 28th, 1725, a petition was presented to the mayor
and corporation, signed by the principal traders in Norwich,
requesting the use of the New Hall in St. Andrew&rsquo;s for an
Exchange, which was immediately granted.&nbsp; On October 4th of
the same year, the court, attended by nearly 200 gentlemen and
principal tradesmen, came to the New Hall in St. Andrew&rsquo;s,
which was then opened and solemnly proclaimed to be an exchange,
on which occasion the Recorder (Stephen Gardiner, Esq.) delivered
the following address:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&mdash;This place is now opened with
an intent to promote traffic and commerce.&nbsp; Here, formerly,
God was worshipped, though in a corrupt manner; and may the
consideration of the sacred use this building has been put to so
far influence all that shall resort hither, that nothing in the
course of business may be here transacted but with great justice
and honesty.&nbsp; I wish success to this undertaking, and the
prosperity of the city in every respect.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hall continued open as an exchange only one year, and it
was open every day in the week except Saturdays and Sundays,
which proves that a considerable mercantile trade must have been
carried on in the city at that time.&nbsp; Soon afterwards was
begun the impolitic system of local taxation in trade, which has
almost ruined Lynn and Yarmouth, and which greatly retarded the
prosperity of Norwich.&nbsp; In 1725 the corporation obtained an
act, which came into operation on May 1st, 1726, for levying
tolls upon all goods or merchandise brought up the river higher
than Thorpe Hall.&nbsp; The dues were to be applied towards
rebuilding the walls and bridges, &amp;c., but this was done to a
very small extent.</p>
<p>On February 24th, 1726, in consequence of the proceedings of
the Pretender, Charles Stuart, who endeavoured to secure the
crown of England, a loyal address of the corporation was
presented to King George I. by the city members.&nbsp; That
monarch died at the palace of the Bishop of Osnaburgh, on his way
to Hanover, on June 11th, 1727.</p>
<p>George II. and his Queen Caroline were crowned on October
11th, 1727, and there was a grand illumination and bonfire here
in honour of the event.</p>
<p><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>In
1729 an act was passed for the better regulating the city
elections, and for preserving the peace, good order, and
government of the city; and at an assembly on the Guild eve, the
mayor and aldermen of Norwich first sat in the council chamber,
and the common council in their own room; for by that act a
majority of each body was required to a corporate order, whilst,
before it passed, the two bodies sat, debated, and voted
together.&nbsp; In 1730, under this act, three nominees for each
of the four great wards were first elected, who returned the
remaining number of common councilmen, sixty in the whole.</p>
<p>In 1730, the <i>Norwich Mercury</i> was first issued by
William Chase.&nbsp; It was afterwards published for many years
by the late Mr. Richard Mackenzie Bacon and Mr. Kinnebrook.&nbsp;
Mr. R. M. Bacon was the editor, and one of the most talented men
who ever appeared in this city as a political writer and
critic.&nbsp; He was the author of &ldquo;The Elements of Vocal
Science,&rdquo; and other works.</p>
<p>At the quarterly assembly held in 1730, on St. Matthias&rsquo;
day, 161 freemen were admitted and sworn, and afterwards it was
reported by the committee, appointed for that purpose, that they
had treated with St. George&rsquo;s Company, who had agreed to
resign their books, charters, and records, into the hands of the
corporation, which was done accordingly, and the power of the
company ceased.&nbsp; In consequence of this, the form of a
procession was arranged for the Guild day instead of that
formerly exhibited, by the St. George&rsquo;s Company.&nbsp; It
was further ordered that, for <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>the future, every mayor shall be
excused making a Guild breakfast, or holding any mayor&rsquo;s
feasts in May or August, as heretofore, and that, in lieu
thereof, the new mayor shall make a feast, on the day on which he
is sworn, at the New Hall, and there entertain the recorder,
steward, sheriffs, justices, aldermen, and their ladles, and the
common councilmen; and every mayor who makes such a feast shall
be entitled to the sum of &pound;100, to be paid by the
chamberlain immediately after the said feast.</p>
<p>In 1732, Sherers&rsquo; Cross, commonly called Charing Cross,
a neat ancient stone pillar, was taken down.&nbsp; The cross was
so called from the sheermen or cloth cutters, who principally
dwelt in this part of the city.&nbsp; The corner house, in the
reign of Edward II., belonged to Christopher Shere-hill, or at
Sherers&rsquo; hill.&nbsp; In the same year the old Market Cross
was demolished, being sadly out of repair.</p>
<p>In 1733, July 11th, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Walpole, of
Houghton in Norfolk, was, in person, sworn a freeman of the
corporation, and presented by the mayor with a copy of his
freedom in a gold box.</p>
<p>In 1734, Sir Robert Walpole presented the city with a gilt
mace, beautifully enchased, weighing 168 ounces.&nbsp; On the cup
part are the arms of Sir Robert and of the city.&nbsp; A new
damask gown was also bought by the corporation, to be worn by the
Speaker on all public occasions.</p>
<p>On October 30th, 1739, being the king&rsquo;s birthday, war
was proclaimed here against Spain.&nbsp; The mayor and aldermen
attended on horseback in their scarlet <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>gowns, with
the two sheriffs, who appeared for the first time in the gold
chains given by Thomas Emerson, Esq., of London, a native of this
city, to be worn by the sheriffs of Norwich for the time
being.&nbsp; A portrait of him was placed in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall at the expense of the corporation, and the honorary freedom
of the city was afterwards presented to him.</p>
<p>In 1740, the cathedral was cleaned and repaired.&nbsp; It was
again repaired and beautified in 1763, in Bishop Younge&rsquo;s
time; and in 1777 and 1780, two painted windows, representing the
Transfiguration and the twelve Apostles (finely executed by the
Lady of the late Dean Lloyd), were placed in the east end of the
choir.&nbsp; Subsequently, these windows were removed to another
part of the cathedral.</p>
<p>In 1741, April 4th, it was ordered by the corporation of
Norwich, that no stranger should exercise any trade in the city
more than six months without taking up his freedom.</p>
<p>In 1744, May 3rd, war was proclaimed here against France, by
the mayor and corporation, on horseback.</p>
<p>In September, 1745, the magistrates and principal inhabitants
associated in support of the government and in defence of the
liberties of the land, in consequence of the rebellion in
Scotland.&nbsp; An artillery company, of about 100 men, was
raised in Norwich, and Lord Hobart appointed commander.</p>
<p>In 1746, October 9th, there was a general thanksgiving on the
suppression of the Rebellion in Scotland.&nbsp; A magnificent
arch was erected in Norwich Market Place, which, with the whole
city, was illuminated.</p>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>In
1747, an act was passed for holding the county summer assizes and
sessions in the city, till a new Shirehall could be built.</p>
<p>On February 7th, 1748, peace with France and Spain was
proclaimed here, the mayor and corporation attending on
horseback, preceded by a party of dragoons and the artillery
company.</p>
<p>On October 22nd, 1751, a fire broke out, which destroyed the
bridewell and several adjoining houses.&nbsp; That extraordinary
man, &ldquo;Peter, the Wild Youth,&rdquo; was confined there at
the time.&nbsp; When a child, he was lost in a wood in Germany,
and was found, at the age of 12, naked and wild.&nbsp; This
bridewell house was built about the year 1370, by Bartholomew
Appleyard, whose son William was, in 1403, the first Mayor of
Norwich.&nbsp; There are some fine arched vaults under the
premises, and the wall next St. Andrew&rsquo;s church, built with
flint, is well worthy the observation of the curious.</p>
<p>An act was passed this year (1751) to open the Port of
Yarmouth for the importation of wool and woollen yarn from
Ireland, which was very beneficial to the city.</p>
<p>The number of houses and inhabitants, in the city precincts
and hamlets, in 1752, was as follows:&mdash;7139 houses, 36,169
souls, being an increase of 7288 inhabitants since 1693, when the
population was only 28,881.</p>
<p>In 1755, a table was drawn up settling the habits to be worn
by the mayor and corporation at public meetings.</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>A
slight shock of an earthquake was felt here on January 10th,
1756.&nbsp; On May 3rd of the same year, the freedom of the city
was voted to the Right Hon. Wm. Pitt, and Henry B. Legge (the
former being late secretary of state, and the latter, chancellor
of the exchequer), for their conduct during their honourable but
short administration.&nbsp; The freedom of the city, and thanks
of the corporation, were also voted to Matthew Goss, Esq., for
his present of the gold chain which has ever since been worn by
the mayors.&nbsp; A public subscription was made for the poor, in
consequence of the high price of wheat, and scarcity of work, and
12,000 persons in Norwich were supplied with household bread at
half-price for some time.</p>
<p>On July 12th, 1756, the Earl of Orford put the act for the
better regulating the Militia in execution.&nbsp; This act fixed
the number of men to be raised for Norfolk and Norwich at 960, of
which the city furnished 151.</p>
<p>On June 21st, 1759, there was a most violent storm here, some
of the hailstones being two inches long, and weighing
three-quarters of an ounce.&nbsp; On July 4th and 5th, the
Norfolk Militia, commanded by Lord Orford, marched from Norwich
to Portsmouth, and passed in review before His Majesty George
II., at Kensington.</p>
<p>In digging under the rampart of the Castle Hill in 1760, two
very curious bones were discovered, supposed by some to be
amulets, which the Druids wore at their sacrifices.</p>
<p><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>In
1760, King George II. died at Kensington, on October 25th, and
his grandson, George III. was proclaimed king, in Norwich, on the
29th, by the mayor and corporation, preceded by the four Norwich
companies of militia, with flags, banners, and music.&nbsp; On
September 22nd, 1761, the coronation of their Majesties was
celebrated with great splendour in Norfolk, and in Norwich there
was a general illumination, and a grand display of fireworks from
a triumphal arch erected in the Market Place.</p>
<p>On October 27th, 1762, there was a sudden flood in the city,
which laid near 300 houses and 8 parish churches under
water.&nbsp; It rose 12 feet perpendicular in 24 hours, being 15
inches higher than St. Faith&rsquo;s flood in 1696.</p>
<p>In 1763, January 3rd, John Spurrell, Esq., died, leaving
&pound;1355 to the corporation, the interest to be applied for
the benefit of the poor in the Great Hospital, and for other
charitable purposes.&nbsp; The Earl of Buckinghamshire, alderman
Thomas Harvey, and Mr. Robert Page, gave &pound;100 each to
Doughty&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p>In the same year <i>Sir Armine Wodehouse</i>, <i>Bart.</i>,
gave a valuable volume to the corporation containing some old
statutes, in which the prescriptive right of the corporation to
its present legal name is supported.&nbsp; It had been the
property of the Wodehouse family for 200 years.&nbsp; A vote of
thanks was passed to Sir Armine Wodehouse for his present.&nbsp;
He was a member of parliament for Norfolk from 1736 to 1768 (32
years), and died in 1777.&nbsp; His <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>death was occasioned by a
herring-bone sticking in his throat.</p>
<p>On January 7th, 1769, the church belonging to the Dutch
congregation was opened for the poor of the workhouses.&nbsp; The
poor continued to attend till the New Workhouse was built in
Heigham, after which they attended divine service in the chapel
there.</p>
<p>On November 19th, 1770, there was a great flood in Norwich,
four inches higher than that of 1762.&nbsp; The sufferers were
relieved, by a subscription, with money, coals, and bread.&nbsp;
On December 19th, of the same year, there was a violent storm of
wind and rain, such as had not been remembered since 1741.&nbsp;
Happisburgh, Postwick, and Strumpshaw windmills were blown down,
and much damage was done in the city and county; many ships with
their crews were lost on the Norfolk coast.&nbsp; In the same
year the following turnpike roads were made and opened, from St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Gates to Trowse, from St. Stephen&rsquo;s Gates
to Watton, from St. Benedict&rsquo;s Gates to Swaffham, from
Bishop Bridge to Caister near Yarmouth, and from Norwich to
Dereham, Swaffham, and Mattishall.</p>
<p>On March 1st, 1771, the names of the streets and highways in
the city were ordered to be fixed up for the first time; but this
order appears to have been very imperfectly carried out.&nbsp; In
the same year the foundation stone of the Norfolk and Norwich
Hospital was laid by Wm. Fellowes, Esq., who was a great promoter
of that benevolent institution.&nbsp; It was erected by a public
subscription in the city and county; and it was opened on July
11th, 1772, for out-patients; and on <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>November 7th, in that year, for
in-patients.&nbsp; It has been of great benefit to the poor, who
have always been attended by the principal physicians and
surgeons in the city.</p>
<p>In 1774, St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall underwent a complete
alteration.&nbsp; The old gateway and wall next Bridge Street
were taken down, part of the green yard was taken in, and the old
city library room was rebuilt over the gateway, thus defacing all
that part of the hall.&nbsp; At the last restoration the old city
library room was pulled down, and a new porch was erected, with
many other improvements.</p>
<p>In 1779, the new year was ushered in with a most terrible
storm of wind and rain, accompanied with thunder and
lightning.&nbsp; The lead on St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church was rolled
up, and great damage was done in several parts of the city.&nbsp;
In October of this year, the navigation from Coltishall to
Aylsham was completed for boats of thirteen tons burthen, at a
cost of &pound;6000.&nbsp; About this time smuggling was carried
to a great height, even in broad day.</p>
<p>On January 20th, 1780, at a numerous meeting of citizens and
county gentlemen, a petition was agreed to and signed, praying
the house of commons to guard against all unnecessary
expenditure, to abolish sinecure places and pensions, and to
resist the increasing influence of the crown.&nbsp; A strong
protest was afterwards signed against the proceedings of this
meeting.&nbsp; Mr. Coke presented the petition.&nbsp; Armed
associations were formed against the government at Yarmouth,
Lynn, Holt, and other places.</p>
<p><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>On
March 24th, 1783, manufactures of textile fabrics in the city
being very prosperous, the pageant of the Golden Fleece, or what
is called Bishop Blaize, was exhibited by the wool combers, in a
style far surpassing all former processions of the kind in
Norwich.&nbsp; The procession began to move at 10 a.m. from St.
Martin&rsquo;s at Oak, and thence passed through the principal
streets of the city.&nbsp; On December 3rd, of the same year, the
Black Friars&rsquo; Bridge was opened.</p>
<p>In January, 1784, the Amicable Society of Attorneys, in
Norwich, was instituted.&nbsp; On May 1st, at an assembly of the
corporation, the freedom of the city was voted to be presented to
Mr. S. Harvey, Mr. Windham, and Mr. Pitt.&nbsp; On December 13th,
the Norwich Public Library was first opened and located in the
old library room, formerly over the entrance to St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.</p>
<p>On March 25th, 1785, mail coaches, between Norwich and London,
were established, performing a journey of 108 miles in fifteen
hours, by which alteration in the post, letters arrived from
London a day sooner.&nbsp; This was considered a great
improvement.&nbsp; Subsequently, half a dozen stage coaches ran
between Norwich and London daily.&nbsp; In July, after various
ascents by several persons, Major (afterwards General) Money, at
4.25 p.m., ascended with a balloon from Quantrell&rsquo;s
gardens, and at 6 p.m. the car touched the surface of the
sea.&nbsp; During five hours the major remained in this perilous
situation, and at 11.30 p.m. was taken up by the Argus revenue
cutter, eighteen miles <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>off Southwold, bearing west by
north, and he landed at Lowestoft on the following morning.&nbsp;
On October 18th, of the same year, the &ldquo;Friars&rsquo;
Society for the Participation of Useful Knowledge&rdquo; was
instituted.&nbsp; This society first suggested the scheme of the
association for the relief of decayed tradesmen, their widows,
and orphans.&nbsp; With them also originated the Soup Charity in
this city, and it was long supported and conducted by them, but
of late years it has been a separate charity.</p>
<p>On April 26th, 1786, the Norwich and Norfolk Benevolent
Medical Society was instituted.&nbsp; In May, an exact account of
the inhabitants of Norwich was taken from house to house, and the
population was ascertained to be 40,051 souls, exclusive of those
living in the precincts of the Cathedral, being an increase of
nearly 4000 since 1752.&nbsp; This entirely contradicts the
statement of Mr. Arthur Young, in his Tour of England, published
in 1770, to the effect that 72,000 persons were then employed in
manufactures in this city.</p>
<p>On November 5th, 1788, the centenary of the glorious
Revolution of 1688 was celebrated in this city and county by
illuminations, bonfires, public dinners, &amp;c., but more
particularly at Holkham, where Mr. Coke, the late Earl of
Leicester, gave a grand f&ecirc;te, ball, and supper, and a
display of fireworks, &amp;c.&nbsp; The citizens appear to have
been more sensible then than they are now of the immense benefits
they derived from that great change in the British constitution
and government.</p>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>Next
year (1789) a revolution broke out in France and astounded all
Europe.&nbsp; It caused a mighty commotion and a general war,
which lasted many years, and destroyed millions of men.&nbsp;
Norwich, like every other city in England, was affected by it,
and lost nearly all its foreign trade during the terrible
conflict.&nbsp; On July 14th, the Revolution was commemorated by
republicans at the Maid&rsquo;s Head Inn, in this city.&nbsp;
Among the toasts of the day after a dinner were &ldquo;The
Revolutionary Societies in England,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rights of
Man,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Philosophers of France.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Revolution, however, had not advanced very far in its
atrocities when most people regarded it in a very different
light, and associations were formed here against
&ldquo;Levellers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Revolutionists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On December 5th, 1792, the mayor, sheriffs, and seventeen
aldermen of Norwich, pledged themselves to support the
constitution of Kings, Lords, and Commons, as established in
1688.&nbsp; Meetings of the inhabitants were also held in this
city, and in Yarmouth, Lynn, &amp;c., and declarations of loyalty
and attachment to the constitution were unanimously agreed to and
signed; for men had begun to be alarmed by the &ldquo;Reign of
Terror&rdquo; in France.</p>
<p>In 1793 a petition for parliamentary reform, signed by 3741
inhabitants of Norwich, was presented to the House of Commons by
the Hon. H. Hobart, but was not received, it having been printed
previous to presentation.&nbsp; This indicated a great advance in
liberal opinions towards the end of the last century, chiefly
amongst the Nonconformists, who had greatly increased <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>in numbers,
whilst the church was asleep.&nbsp; The vast expenditure in the
long war against France caused a great increase in taxation.</p>
<p>On April 12th, 1794, a great county meeting was held at the
Shirehall, to consider the exertions which should be made at that
crisis for the internal defence and security of the
kingdom.&nbsp; The High Sheriff, T. R. Dashwood, Esq.,
presided.&nbsp; The Honble. C. Townshend moved resolutions,
supported by the Marquis Townshend, Lord Walsingham, Mr. Buxton,
Mr. Windham, and Mr. Joddrell, for forming volunteer corps of
cavalry, and for entering into subscriptions to maintain the
same.&nbsp; Mr. Coke condemned the war <i>in toto</i>, and
insisted that it might have been avoided, or at the least brought
to a conclusion, by a negociation for peace, and he moved as an
amendment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That it is our duty to refuse any private
subscriptions for public purposes and unconstitutional
benevolences.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much altercation and confusion ensued, that when the High
Sheriff put the question, it was impossible to tell which party
had the majority; and a division being deemed impracticable, the
chairman proposed that such gentlemen as chose to subscribe would
retire with him to the Grand Jury Room, which was agreed
to.&nbsp; Nearly &pound;6,000 was subscribed, and the amount was
afterwards increased to &pound;11,000!</p>
<p>On October 21st, 1795, a memorial was transmitted from the
court of mayoralty of Norwich to the representatives of the city
on the high prices of every necessary of life, requesting them to
support such <a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>measures as might have a tendency to reduce them, and
to facilitate the restoration of peace.&nbsp; Prices of corn and
provisions had risen to an alarming height; wheat to 100s.,
barley to 30s., and oats to 30s. per quarter, and symptoms of
rioting had in consequence appeared in Norwich market.</p>
<p>At a county meeting held on July 20th, 1796, in the Angel Inn
(now the Royal Hotel) it was resolved to petition parliament for
the removal of the Lent assizes from Thetford to Norwich, and a
petition was presented accordingly.&nbsp; The bill brought for
this object into the House of Commons was strongly opposed, and
finally rejected; but afterwards the assizes were removed to the
city, and have been held there ever since.&nbsp; This year the
sum of &pound;24,000 was collected for the maintenance of the
poor in Norwich, while the population was under 40,000, or half
the present number.</p>
<p>In 1797, February 14th, the Norwich Light Horse Volunteers
were organized, of which John Harvey, Esq., was afterwards
appointed captain and major.&nbsp; On February 22nd, the Norwich
Loyal Military Association was formed, of which John Patteson,
Esq., was appointed captain, and afterwards major; and R. J.
Browne, C. Harvey, and A. Sieley, Esqs., were appointed
captains.&nbsp; Military matters then occupied a great deal of
the attention of the citizens.</p>
<p>On March 4th, intelligence was received here of the defeat of
the Spanish fleet by Admiral Jervis, and served in some measure
to dissipate the general gloom which at this time pervaded the
public mind.</p>
<p><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>On
April 25th, a great county meeting was held in the open air on
the Castle Hill, and a petition was almost unanimously adopted,
praying His Majesty to dismiss his ministers, as the most
effectual means of reviving the national credit and restoring
peace.&nbsp; This was moved by Mr. Fellowes, seconded by Mr.
Rolfe, supported by Lord Albemarle, Mr. Coke, Mr. Mingay, Mr.
Plumptre, Mr. Trafford, and others.&nbsp; On April 28th a counter
county meeting was held, and an address to the king was adopted,
expressing confidence in the ministry of the day.</p>
<p>On May 16th the citizens followed suit.&nbsp; At a numerously
attended common hall a petition to His Majesty, praying him to
dismiss his administration, was carried unanimously, with the
exception of one spirited Tory, who had nearly fallen a victim to
popular vengeance on the spot.&nbsp; A counter address of the
citizens was afterwards signed and presented to the King, who
must have been a good deal bothered at the time by such evidences
of the violent agitation of his subjects.</p>
<p>On May 26th, attempts were made here to seduce the military
from their allegiance; and on the following day the republican
orator, Thelwall, arrived in this city, which caused a great
commotion.&nbsp; On the 29th, a party of the Inniskilling
Dragoons proceeded to his lecture room, opposite Gurney&rsquo;s
bank, drove out the persons assembled, destroyed the tribune and
benches, and then attacked the Shakespear Tavern adjoining, in
which a disturbance had taken place.&nbsp; After destroying the
furniture and partly demolishing <a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>the house, and also breaking the
windows and destroying the furniture of the Rose Tavern, in which
they supposed the lecturer had concealed himself, the dragoons,
on the appearance of their officers and the magistrates, retired
to their barracks.&nbsp; Thelwall, in this affray, fortunately
for him, escaped and fled to London.&nbsp; Davey, the landlord of
the Shakespear Tavern, on being pursued by the soldiers, threw
himself from the garret into the street, and was much
injured.&nbsp; At the subsequent assizes, Luke Rice, a tailor of
this city, was indicted capitally for aiding and abetting the
soldiers in this outrage; but as the offence charged in the
indictment did not come within the meaning of the statute, he was
acquitted.&nbsp; He had, however, a very narrow escape.&nbsp; On
June 1st of the same year, (1797) a mutiny broke out on board the
fleet at Yarmouth, and several sail of the line hoisted the red
flag of defiance.</p>
<p>In January, 1798, the sword of the Spanish Admiral Don
Francisco Winthuysen, presented by Admiral Nelson to the
corporation of Norwich, was placed in the Council Chamber of the
Guildhall, with an appropriate device and inscription.</p>
<p>On February 28th, at a general meeting of the inhabitants of
this city, more than &pound;2,200 were immediately subscribed as
voluntary contributions towards the defence of the kingdom.&nbsp;
In a few weeks afterwards, the whole subscription amounted to
more than &pound;8000, a proof of the loyalty as well as
liberality of the well-to-do citizens.&nbsp; In May, the
following Loyal Volunteer Corps were formed for the purpose <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>of
preserving internal tranquillity, and supporting the police of
this city, viz., the Mancroft Volunteers, Capt. John Browne; St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Volunteers, Capt. Hardy; St. Peter per
Mountergate, &amp;c., Capt. Herring; St. Saviour&rsquo;s and St.
Clement&rsquo;s, Capt. Fiske; St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Capt. T. A.
Murray.</p>
<p>On June 19th, the Norwich Light Horse Volunteers and Loyal
Military Association attended J. Browne, Esq., to the cathedral,
previous to his being sworn into the office of mayor; afterwards
the Association fired a <i>feu de joie</i> in the Market
Place.</p>
<p>On October 11th, at a meeting of the wealthy inhabitants of
the city, a subscription was entered into for the relief of the
orphans of those brave seamen who fell on August 1st in the ever
memorable battle of the Nile; and on the 24th of the same month,
at a special assembly of the corporation, an address of
congratulation was adopted to his Majesty on the late victory;
and it was agreed that a request should be made to Lord Nelson to
sit for his portrait, to be placed in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall.&nbsp; His Lordship assented and the portrait was painted by
Beechey and placed in the hall, where it may still be seen.</p>
<p>November 29th was appointed as a day of a public thanksgiving
for the late naval victories, and was celebrated as such in
Norwich with the greatest festivity.&nbsp; In the morning the
mayor and corporation, accompanied by the Light Horse Volunteers
and the Parochial Associations, attended divine service at the
cathedral, where an excellent sermon was preached by the Rev. T.
F. Middleton, afterwards Bishop of <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>Calcutta.&nbsp; The sword, taken by
Lord Nelson was borne in the procession.&nbsp; On their return to
the Market Place there was a feast, and in the evening an
illumination.</p>
<p>In 1799, October 28th, the Guards and several other regiments,
to the number of 25,000 cavalry and infantry, landed at Yarmouth
from Holland.&nbsp; Next night the Grenadier Brigade of Guards,
commanded by Col. Wynward, marched into Norwich by torchlight,
and were soon afterwards followed by upwards of 20,000 more
troops.&nbsp; Through the exertions of John Herring, Esq., mayor,
and the attention of the citizens in general, these brave men
received every accommodation that their situation demanded.&nbsp;
The mayor soon afterwards received a letter from the Duke of
Portland expressive of the high appreciation by the government of
the mayor&rsquo;s loyalty and activity on this occasion, and of
the humanity of the citizens who supplied the wants of the
soldiers.&nbsp; The mayor was afterwards presented to his Majesty
at St. James&rsquo;, and offered the honour of knighthood, which
he declined.&nbsp; The Duke of York, Prince William of
Gloucester, and several other officers employed in this
unsuccessful expedition, also passed through the city on their
way to London.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;18,000 was raised this
year for the maintenance of the poor of the city.</p>
<p>On January 23rd, 1800, John Herring, Esq., then mayor,
summoned a general meeting of the inhabitants at the Guildhall,
to consider the propriety of applying to parliament for an act
for the better paving, lighting, and watching of the city, for
removing and preventing <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>annoyances and obstructions, and for
regulating hackney coaches.&nbsp; At this meeting a committee was
appointed to consider the plan proposed, and to report to a
future general meeting.&nbsp; This committee held several
meetings, and at length made a report, which was laid before a
general meeting of the citizens on March 3rd.&nbsp; The estimated
cost of lighting, watching, paving, &amp;c., was only
&pound;2770.&nbsp; The produce of the tolls was estimated at
&pound;1715, and of a rate of 6d. in the pound at &pound;3000;
making the total receipts &pound;4715, and leaving a balance of
&pound;1945 for the commencement of the work, which sum would
have been increased by some annual payments.&nbsp; The general
meeting adopted the report, and a petition was signed by most of
the inhabitants of the city in favour of a bill to carry out the
improvements.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, the petition could
not, from some unforeseen circumstances, be presented that
session.&nbsp; The project was, for a time, postponed; but an act
was obtained in 1806 to carry out the object, and commissioners
were appointed for the purpose.&nbsp; This body consisted of the
dean and prebend, the recorder, 28 members of the corporation,
and 24 parochial commissioners, annually elected, in all
136.&nbsp; This heterogeneous body continued for about forty
years, and after spending over &pound;300,000, left Norwich the
worst paved town in England, and also left a debt of
&pound;17,000, which still remains as a legacy to the city!</p>
<h4><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>Social State of the City in the Eighteenth
Century.</h4>
<p>Before the end of the 18th century, various improvements were
made, among which may be mentioned, the demolition of the old
gates, the widening and opening of several streets, and the
erection of a new flour mill, worked by steam power, near Black
Friars Bridge, for better supplying the people with flour.&nbsp;
Still, large numbers of the poor appear to have been for a long
time in a very destitute condition.&nbsp; Famines were of
frequent occurrence, and riots often took place on account of the
high prices of every kind of food.&nbsp; In 1720, on September
20th, a dangerous riot broke out, and rose to such a height, as
to oblige the sheriffs to call in the aid of the Artillery
Company, at whose approach the rioters instantly dispersed.&nbsp;
Again, in 1740, riots occurred in several parts of the country,
and in most of the towns in Norfolk.&nbsp; The magistrates of
this city called the military to their aid, and six or seven
lives were lost before the rioters could be quelled.&nbsp; Again,
in 1766, in consequence of the great scarcity and advanced price
of provisions of every sort, some dangerous riots broke out in
several places.&nbsp; In this city the poor people collected on
September 27th, about noon, and in the course of that day and the
next, committed many outrages by attacking the houses of bakers,
pulling down part of the New Mills, destroying large quantities
of flour, and burning to the ground a large malthouse outside of
Conisford gate.&nbsp; Every lenient <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>measure was tried by the city
magistrates to pacify the poor starving people, but to no
effect.&nbsp; The magistrates therefore were compelled to repel
force by force.&nbsp; On Sunday afternoon they, with the
principal inhabitants, attacked the rioters with such vigour,
while they were demolishing a house on Tombland, that they were
dispersed.&nbsp; About thirty of the ringleaders were taken and
tried, and eight of them were sentenced to death, but only two
were executed.&nbsp; They suffered the extreme penalty on January
10th, 1767.</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, Norwich was, at this time, in a more
flourishing state as regards trade than it has ever since been
known.&nbsp; Wages were not high, but employment was
universal.&nbsp; On April 25th, 1796, fine flour having risen to
70s. a sack, a mob attacked several bakers&rsquo; shops in the
city.&nbsp; The magistrates and inhabitants assembled and
proceeded to the places against which the attacks of the populace
were directed, but the mob did not disperse till after the riot
act had been read and three persons apprehended.&nbsp; On May
17th, a dreadful affray took place near Bishop Bridge, between
the soldiers of the Northumberland and Warwickshire regiments of
Militia.&nbsp; Several were terribly bruised and others wounded
with bayonets before their officers could part them.&nbsp;
Education was, at this time, at a very low ebb, and the clergy
neglected the poor.&nbsp; Few schools were yet opened for their
children, who grew up in ignorance and vice.&nbsp; Working-men
spent their hard-earned money in drunkenness, or indulged in the
most brutal <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>sports, such as prize-fighting or cock-fighting.&nbsp;
They were also demoralised by bribery and treating at contested
elections.&nbsp; In fact, ward elections were so frequent that
the city was kept in a perpetual state of agitation and
turmoil.&nbsp; We can now form no notion of the misery, poverty,
and vice, which these local elections inflicted on the
city.&nbsp; It was often said that a single ward election did
more harm than all the sermons in all the churches and chapels
did good.&nbsp; These local contests at length prevented capital
being employed in manufacturers, and made politics the first
object of all the influential citizens, who, if they were not,
strove to become, members of the old corporation, not from any
consideration of public duty, not to promote the welfare of the
citizens, but to serve their own political or personal
interests.&nbsp; There is abundant evidence that the prosperity
of the city, and private friendships, were alike poisoned by the
party spirit, engendered by frequent ward elections; at the same
time the moral character of the whole working population was
greatly deteriorated, and the working classes themselves greatly
depraved.</p>
<h4>Nonconformity in the 18th Century.</h4>
<p>During this 18th century the Nonconformists became very
numerous and powerful in the city and county.&nbsp; Methodism
imparted a healthful stimulus to the revival of religion.&nbsp;
It aroused the church and all denominations.&nbsp; Besides the
very flourishing bodies of Wesleyans and Baptists, the
Independents made <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>great progress.&nbsp; Within two centuries, in place of
one, several chapels arose; and throughout all England, few towns
exhibited a greater increase of Nonconformists than
Norwich.&nbsp; We have already given an account of their rise and
progress in the 17th century, but we have not yet noticed the
Unitarians.&nbsp; A history of the Octagon chapel in Norwich, by
Mr. John Taylor, formerly of this city, and continued by his son,
Mr. Edward Taylor, contains a full account of the rise and
progress of the Unitarians here.&nbsp; They were at first called
Presbyterians, but that name was inappropriate, as they never had
the Presbyterian polity nor doctrine.&nbsp; Mr. John Taylor says,
the first Presbyterian chapel was built in 1687, on a piece of
ground, formerly part of the great garden or orchard,
&ldquo;sometime belonging to the prior and convent of the late
friars&rsquo; preachers,&rdquo; of whose deserted walls the
Dissenters took possession.&nbsp; The building was so constructed
that it might be converted into dwelling houses in case their
preachers were compelled to abandon it.</p>
<p>Blomefield, in his History of the City, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In 1687, the Presbyterians built a meeting
house from the ground, over against the Black Boys; and at the
same time the Independents repaired a house in St. Edmund&rsquo;s
formerly a brew house.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the passing of the Toleration Act, in 1689, this meeting
house, which, had not been long finished, was duly
licensed.&nbsp; Dr. Collinges, a learned Presbyterian minister,
was the first pastor appointed to preach <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>by the
congregation.&nbsp; He had a considerable hand in the
&ldquo;Annotations to the Bible,&rdquo; which were begun and
carried on by Mr. Matthew Poole, and which go under his name.</p>
<p>Dr. Collinges died in January, 1690, and was probably
succeeded soon after by Mr. Josiah Chorley, who was not a native
of Norwich, but came from Lancashire.&nbsp; He officiated about
thirty years, and was succeeded by the Rev. Peter Finch, a highly
esteemed preacher for many years.&nbsp; After he died his funeral
sermon was preached by Mr. Taylor, who said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Surely the character of Mr. Finch, drawn
out so even and clear without any remarkable spot or flaw,
through the long course of sixty-three years in this city, must
be deserving of remembrance and imitation, since it must be the
result of a steady integrity and solid wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Finch was one of the first pupils who entered
into the first dissenting academy, erected after the Reformation,
by the Rev. Mr. Frankland; and he survived almost all the 300
gentlemen who, in the space of thirty years, were educated in
that academy.&nbsp; He died October 6th, 1754, on his 93rd
birthday, and was buried in St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, in this
city.&nbsp; His descendents were residents here till 1847.&nbsp;
His son was many years clerk of the peace for the county of
Norfolk.</p>
<p>Mr. John Brooke was invited to take his place towards the end
of the year 1718.&nbsp; This minister was born in or near
Yarmouth, where some of his descendants have generally
resided.&nbsp; He resigned in <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>1733, and removed to York, where he
died.&nbsp; Dr. John Taylor was elected to the vacant office in
1733, and continued till 1757, when he resigned.&nbsp; He was the
author of many works of a religious character.&nbsp; In 1753 the
old chapel was pulled down, and a subscription was raised of
nearly &pound;4000 for a new one.&nbsp; The first stone of the
new building was laid on February 25th, 1754, by Dr. Taylor; and
within three years the present elegant chapel was completed at a
cost of &pound;5174.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Bourn, son of Mr. Bourn of Birmingham, was ordained
co-pastor with Dr. John Taylor, and he published volumes of
sermons which established his reputation in that kind of
composition.&nbsp; He resigned in 1775, and retired to a village
near Norwich.&nbsp; Several gentlemen, who afterwards attained
considerable eminence in science, were brought up under Mr.
Bourn&rsquo;s ministry, viz., Sir James Edward Smith, so long
president of the Linnean Society; Mr. Robert Woodhouse, the
eminent mathematician and professor of astronomy at Cambridge;
and Dr. Edward Maltby, afterwards bishop of Durham.&nbsp; Mr.
Bourn removed to Norwich not many months before his death, and
died in the 83rd year of his age; he was interred in the burying
ground of the Octagon Chapel.&nbsp; Mr. Bourn was succeeded by
the Rev. John Hoyle, who was minister for seventeen years.&nbsp;
He died in the 51st year of his age, on November 29th, 1775, and
was interred in the Octagon burying ground.</p>
<p>On December 15th, 1776, Mr. Alderson was chosen minister, and
soon afterwards Mr. George Cadogan <a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>Morgan became co-pastor.&nbsp; He
had been educated under the inspection of his uncle, the
celebrated Dr. Richard Price, so that great expectations were
formed of his abilities, and the congregation were not
disappointed.&nbsp; He soon, however, resigned and went to
Yarmouth; and in 1755, Dr. William Enfield was invited to become
co-pastor with Mr. Alderson, and he accepted the office.&nbsp; In
1786, Mr. Alderson resigned; and in 1787 was succeeded by Mr. P.
Houghton.</p>
<p>In 1784, Mr. P. M. Martineau projected the establishment of
the Public Library at Norwich, in which he was cordially seconded
by Dr. Enfield, who was one of the earliest presidents of an
institution, which for the extent and variety of its catalogue
surpasses most provincial libraries.&nbsp; In the early periods
of the first French Revolution, a periodical work was established
by the liberal party in Norwich, entitled &ldquo;The
Cabinet;&rdquo; to which the principal contributors were Mr. John
Pitchford, Mr. Wm. Youngman, Mr. Norgate, Mr. C. Marsh
(afterwards M.P. for Retford), Mrs. Opie (then Miss Alderson),
Mr. John Taylor, and Dr. Enfield.&nbsp; After publishing many
learned works, Dr. Enfield died in the 57th year of his age, on
November 3rd, 1797.&nbsp; After his death, three volumes of his
sermons were published by subscription; and among the subscribers
were persons of almost every sect in Norwich, from the cathedral
prebendary to the independent minister.&nbsp; More than twenty
beneficed clergymen&rsquo;s names appear in the list, and it is
very well known that Dr. Enfield&rsquo;s sermons have been heard
from many pulpits of the established church.&nbsp; Professor
Taylor, late of Gresham college, thus wrote in a supplementary
memoir:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>&ldquo;With his dissenting brethren Dr. Enfield was
always on the best terms, especially with Mr. Newton and Mr.
Kinghorn, the ministers of the Independent and Baptist
congregations.&nbsp; The Presbyterian congregation, comprising
many individuals of station and influence in the city, took the
lead in every movement of the dissenting body, who never appeared
in a more united and honourable position than when Dr. Enfield
was their acknowledged head.&nbsp; The state of society during
his residence in Norwich, was eminently suited to his habits and
tastes.&nbsp; Parr, Peel, Walker, Howes, and Smyth were his
contemporaries.&nbsp; Parr was the head master of the grammar
school, Potter was a prebendary of the Cathedral, and Porson was
occasional resident at the house of his brother-in-law, Mr. Hawes
of Coltishall, a village a few miles from Norwich.&nbsp; Dr.
Enfield was a welcome visitor at the bishop&rsquo;s palace; for
though Dr. Bagot had no political or religious sympathy with the
minister of the Presbyterian congregation, he knew how to
estimate his talents, his manners, and his admirable
conversational powers.&nbsp; Among the residents in Norwich at
this time, with whom Dr. Enfield associated, were Dr. Sayers, Mr.
William Taylor, Mr. Hudson Gurney (afterwards M.P. for Newport
and a vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries), Dr. Rigby,
Dr. Lubbock, Sir James Edward Smith, the Rev. John Walker (an
accomplished scholar and one of the minor canons of the
Cathedral), Mrs. Opie (then Miss Alderson), Mr. Bruckner, the
minister of the Dutch and French protestant congregations at
Norwich, and others, who though unknown to the world as authors,
were yet worthy associates in such a society.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Enfield&rsquo;s estimate of the character of society at
Norwich, is thus expressed in a letter from Liverpool to
Professor Taylor&rsquo;s father:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>&ldquo;You will easily imagine the pleasure I feel in
enjoying the society of my old friends here, especially that of
Mr. Roscoe and Dr. Currie; but with these and a few other
exceptions, I find more congenial associates at Norwich.&nbsp;
For a man of literary tastes and pursuits, I can truly say that I
know of no town which offers so eligible a residence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Roscoe and Dr. Currie, referred to above, were then in
high reputation in Liverpool.</p>
<p>The altered state of society in Norwich, about the end of the
18th century is thus depicted in a paper in the Monthly Magazine
for March, 1808, under the title of &ldquo;Fanaticism&mdash;a
Vision,&rdquo; which was generally attributed to the pen of Sir
James Edward Smith:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You know the flourishing and happy state of
this ancient city in the early part of your life, and
particularly how peaceably and even harmoniously its inhabitants
lived together on the score of religion.&nbsp; Christians of
various denominations had each their churches, their chapels, or
their meeting houses, and in the common intercourse of life all
conducted themselves as brethren.&nbsp; The interests of humanity
would even frequently bring them together on particular occasions
to pay their devotions in the same temple.&nbsp; The bishop
(Bathurst) treated as his children all who, though they disowned
his spiritual authority, obeyed his Divine Master; while the
Presbyterian, the Independent, the Catholic, and the Quaker,
partook of his hospitality and repaid his benevolence with
gratitude and respect.&nbsp; This state of society, worthy of
real Christians, was broken up by those who wore that character
only as a mask.&nbsp; A set of men, interested in promoting
dissensions, by which villany and rapacity might profit, and in
decrying those genuine <a name="page301"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 301</span>fruits of religion, that salutary
faith and pure morals, which by comparison shamed their own
characters, after long in vain attempting to exalt blind belief
in general, and their particular dogmas, in preference to a
useful and virtuous life, but too successfully obtained their
end.&nbsp; On all the great truths of revealed religion, honest
men could never be long at variance.&nbsp; On disputable points
they had learned a salutary forbearance, which enabled them,
while they thought for themselves, to let others do the
same.&nbsp; The only resources of those who wish to stir up
religious animosity, is to bring forward something that no one
can determine.&nbsp; The less mankind understand a subject, the
more warmly do they debate and strive to enforce the belief of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Eminent Citizens of the 18th
Century</span>.</h4>
<h5><i>Merchants and Manufacturers</i>.</h5>
<p>Among the eminent citizens of this century may be first
mentioned the chief merchants and manufacturers, who were very
intelligent, wealthy, and enterprising.&nbsp; They were also
benevolent, and the founders of various charitable
institutions.&nbsp; Many of them were Nonconformists, and active
supporters of their chapels, while they carried on a great
foreign trade.&nbsp; The correspondence which they had begun on
the continent they extended in every direction.&nbsp; By sending
their sons to be educated in Germany, Italy, and Spain, they
cultivated a more familiar connection with those countries.&nbsp;
Their travellers also were acquainted with various languages, and
went all over Europe, exhibiting their pattern cards in every
town on the continent.&nbsp; <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>Norwich could then boast of rich,
energetic, enterprising, and intelligent men, who made the city
what it was in their day.&nbsp; Lest their very names should be

<h5><i>Mr. John Kirkpatrick</i>.</h5>
<p>Mr. John Kirkpatrick, a linen merchant, who lived in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s, was a learned antiquarian of this period, to whom
the city is greatly indebted for his researches and documents
respecting the antiquities of Norwich, but only fragments have
been published.&nbsp; The late Mr. Hudson Gurney obtained
possession of most of his manuscripts, and published his account
of the &ldquo;Religious Orders in Norwich,&rdquo; in 1845.&nbsp;
This work was compiled from a manuscript quarto volume of 258
pages, in the handwriting of the author.&nbsp; Mr. Dawson Turner,
the editor, says, in the preface:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s father was a native
of the village of Closeburn, in Dumfriesshire, a fact recorded by
his son in his will, and further proved by the arms on his tomb
(in St. Helen&rsquo;s church) which are those of the
baronet&rsquo;s family of Kirkpatrick, of Closeburn.&nbsp; From
Scotland he removed to Norwich, where he resided in the parish of
St. Stephen.&nbsp; <a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>His son John was apprenticed in that of St. Clement,
and subsequently established himself in business as a linen
merchant, in St. Andrew&rsquo;s, in premises opposite Bridewell
Alley.&nbsp; He was there in partnership with Mr. John Custance,
who was mayor in 1726, and was the founder of the family of that
name at Weston.&nbsp; In the year of his partner&rsquo;s
mayoralty, Mr. Kirkpatrick was appointed treasurer to the Great
Hospital, in St. Helen&rsquo;s, an office which his premature
decease allowed him to occupy only for two years.&nbsp; He
married the youngest daughter of Mr. John Harvey,
great-grandfather of the late Lieut.-Colonel Harvey, of Thorpe
Lodge, where his portrait was preserved during the lifetime of
that gentleman.&nbsp; It has since been engraved in the very
interesting series of portraits of the more eminent inhabitants
of Norfolk, of whom no likenesses have yet appeared, a work now
in course of publication, under the superintendence of Mr.
Ewing.&nbsp; With such, Kirkpatrick is deservedly
associated.&nbsp; He died childless.&nbsp; Of his family, nothing
more is known than that he had a brother of the name of Thomas,
who is mentioned by Blomefield as being chamberlain of Norwich at
the time he wrote.&nbsp; The account books of the corporation
contain several entries in reference to both the one and the
other, but not of sufficient interest to warrant the quoting of
them at length.&nbsp; Of the latter, they shew that he was
elected chamberlain with a salary of thirty pounds per annum, in
the room of Matthew King, in 1732; that in the same year, the
freedom of the city was conferred upon him; and that twelve years
subsequently he was removed from his office, by reason of
irregularity of his accounts.&nbsp; To the antiquary, their
testimony is invariably honourable; the most frequent notices
being, votes of money for the service he had rendered in
adjusting the different accounts of the city.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>Mr.
Dawson Turner further states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Kirkpatrick was one of the most able,
laborious, learned, and useful antiquaries whom the county has
produced.&nbsp; He was especially an indefatigable searcher into
local antiquities, and had his life been spared to the term
allotted by the holy Psalmist to man, it were impossible to say
how much of what is now irretrievably lost to us might have been
rescued from oblivion.&nbsp; He had accumulated copious
materials, but his early death prevented him from digesting and
publishing them.&nbsp; Better far had he contented himself with
amassing less, and turning what he had got to account; a lesson
hard to learn, but most important to be borne in mind and acted
upon.&nbsp; As it was, he was obliged to leave the fulfilment of
his task to others; taking all possible care for the safety of
his collections, and not doubting that those who came after him,
seeing what was prepared for their hands, would cheerfully
undertake the office, perhaps with a praiseworthy zeal for
communicating information, perhaps with the not less natural
desire of building their own fame upon the labours of their
predecessors.&nbsp; But in his expectations he was sadly
mistaken, and has but furnished an additional proof how difficult
it is for any one to enter completely into the objects and ideas
of another, and consequently how imperative it is upon all,
ourselves to finish the web we have begun, if we wish to see it
come perfect and uniform from the loom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blomefield, who was a contemporary, acknowledges his great
obligations to the learned Norwich antiquary, and recorded the
death of his friend and his being buried in St. Helen&rsquo;s
Church, Norwich.&nbsp; The tomb, a black marble monument, by the
steps of the altar, bears the following arms and
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>&ldquo;<i>Argent</i>, a saltier and on a chief,<br />
<i>Azure</i>, three woolpacks of the field,<br />
<i>Crest</i>, a hand holding a dagger proper,<br />
<i>Motto</i>&mdash;I make sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here resteth in hope of a joyful resurrection, the body
of John Kirkpatrick of this city, Merchant, and Treasurer to this
Hospital.&nbsp; He was a man of sound judgment, good
understanding and extensive knowledge; industrious in his
business, and indefatigable in that of the Corporation in which
he was constantly employed.&nbsp; He died, very much lamented by
all that knew him, on the 20th day of August, in the year of our
Lord, 1728, aged 42.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h5><i>The Rev. F. Blomefield</i>.</h5>
<p>The Rev. Francis Blomefield, rector of Fersfield, lived some
time in this city, compiling his history of Norwich, which he
brought down to the year 1742.&nbsp; He was born at Fersfield,
July 23rd, 1705.&nbsp; He was installed rector of that parish in
1729, when he almost immediately commenced collecting materials
for a history of his native county, but his work is more a
topographical survey than a history.&nbsp; He did not live to
complete it, having caught the small-pox when in London, of which
he died, in the 46th year of his age, on January 15th,
1751.&nbsp; He began printing his great work in 1736.&nbsp; In
1769 it was continued (but not completed) in five folio volumes
by the Rev. Charles Parker, M.A., rector of Oxburgh.</p>

as an excise officer, and his great talents introduced him to the
most scientific characters of this city.&nbsp; He obtained the
situation of clerk to the New Mills, in Heigham, and was a
considerable contributor to Mr. Baker&rsquo;s works on the
Microscope.&nbsp; Many of his papers on Natural History are
published in the transactions of the Royal Society.&nbsp; He died
in 1767, and was buried in Heigham churchyard.</p>
<p><i>Anna Letitia Barbauld</i>, sister of Dr. Aikin, of
Yarmouth, resided at Norwich.&nbsp; She was the authoress of

children, and died in 1825.</p>
<p><i>Peter Barlow</i>, the celebrated mathematician, and author
of many of the articles in Rees&rsquo; Encyclop&aelig;dia, and
the Encyclop&aelig;dia Metropolitana, was the son of a warper of
this city.&nbsp; He was born October, 1766, in the parish of St.
Simon and Jude.</p>
<p><i>Sir William Beechey</i>, the eminent painter, resided in
this city in the early part of his life, and executed several of

celebrated portrait of Lord Nelson.&nbsp; He was knighted by
George III., and appointed portrait painter to his majesty.</p>
<p><i>Hancock Blythe</i>, schoolmaster, mathematician, and
teacher of languages, resided in Timberhill, and was the author
of several small works on astronomy.&nbsp; He died in 1795, aged
73 years.</p>
<p><i>John Brand</i>, <i>B.A.</i>, was a native of this
city.&nbsp; His father was a saddler in London Lane.&nbsp; Young
Brand, having a turn for study, went for some years to the <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>continent,
where he acquired the languages and customs of the people so
strongly, that on his return to England he received the
soubriqu&ecirc;t of Abb&egrave; Brand.&nbsp; In 1744 he was
reader at St. Peter&rsquo;s Mancroft.&nbsp; He was the author of
several articles in the <i>British Critic</i>.&nbsp; He was
rector of St. George&rsquo;s, Southwark, and of Wickham Skeith,
in Suffolk.&nbsp; He died in February, 1809.</p>
<p><i>Henry Cooper</i>, barrister at law, was born in the parish
of St. Peter&rsquo;s Mancroft.&nbsp; He was sent to sea in the
early part of his life, but was afterwards called to the bar, and
was made attorney general of the Bermudas.&nbsp; After a
brilliant career, in which he rapidly became one of the leaders
of the Norfolk circuit, he died, after being twelve years at the
bar, in 1825.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Reuben Deave</i> was a large manufacturer in this city,
who, in December, 1769, became the fortunate possessor of a prize
in a lottery worth &pound;20,000.&nbsp; The number was
42,903.&nbsp; It came into his possession in the following
singular manner.&nbsp; His foreman, who was in a confidential
position, had bought two tickets in a lottery, and after some
time thought he had speculated too far, and told his employer
that he feared he had done a very foolish thing.&nbsp; Mr. Deave,
being informed of the circumstance, thought so too, but offered
to buy one of the tickets.&nbsp; His foreman took them out of his
pocket and gave Mr. Deave his choice.&nbsp; Mr. Deave, however,
said he would make no choice, and bought the one offered to
him.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards the lottery was drawn, and this
ticket proved to be a fortunate number for &pound;20,000, while
<a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>the
other was a blank.&nbsp; Mr. Deave, who had paid for the ticket,
gave his foreman a cheque for &pound;500, but the poor man was so
vexed at losing the prize that he hung himself on the next
day.&nbsp; Mr. Deave was much grieved at this, and often said
afterwards that the prize never did him any good, for he gave a
power of attorney to a man to draw the money in London, and that
man bolted with it, and was never heard of afterwards.</p>
<p><i>William Enfield</i>, <i>LL.D.</i> an eminent literary
character, was for many years the minister at the Octagon Chapel
here.&nbsp; He was much beloved by his congregation, and died

two volumes of these letters to George III. in 1787, he was
knighted.&nbsp; He died October 14th, 1796.</p>
<p><i>John Fransham</i>, the Norwich Polytheist, a very eccentric
character, was born in St. George&rsquo;s Colegate.&nbsp; He was
an excellent mathematician, and was a great admirer of the
ancient writers on this science.&nbsp; He frequently took rapid
solitary walks, with a broad brimmed hat slouched over his eyes,
and a plaid on his shoulders, and was supposed to sleep often on
Mousehold Heath.&nbsp; He died on February 1st, 1810.&nbsp; His
biography was written by his pupil, Mr. Saint.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Hall</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, a merchant, lived in the
early part of this period.&nbsp; He founded a monthly sacramental
lecture, left several legacies to the charities, and <a

<p>We have now arrived at the present age of political progress,
and material prosperity; the age of inventions, railways,
newspapers, and telegraphs; the age of expansion and general
intelligence.&nbsp; George III., George IV., and William IV.,
have reigned in this century, and have been succeeded by our
beloved Queen Victoria.&nbsp; Under her benign sway the old
semi-barbarous state of society has passed away like a dream, and
we live in a new social era, the result of the progress of
education, of the march of improvement, and of the spread of true
religion.</p>
<p>As it has been often stated by local historians that Norwich
formerly contained a very large population, and as this statement
is very generally believed, we may here correct the mistake by
giving the returns, which show a very gradual, and very slow
increase from the earliest period to the present time.&nbsp; The
parochial returns show that in 1693 the population was only
28,881; in 1752 it had increased to 36,169; and in 1786 to
40,051.&nbsp; This was the greatest number up to the end of the
last century.&nbsp; In 1801 it was 36,832, not including 6,000
recruits for the army, navy, and militia; making the total number
42,832.&nbsp; This indicates a very slow increase of
population.&nbsp; The following are the returns for the present
century: 1801, 36,832; 1811, 37,256; 1821, 50,288; 1831, 61,116;
1841, 62,294; 1851, 68,713; 1861, 74,414, being an increase of
about 500 yearly.&nbsp; Norwich in <a name="page316"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>1752 contained only 7131 houses, and
in 1801 8763, of which 1747 were returned as empty.&nbsp; In 1831
the number was 14,201, of which 13,132 were inhabited.&nbsp; Now
the number is over 21,000, and the rateable value is
&pound;178,882.</p>
<p>We must now leave the stately march of history for a more
broken and interrupted step.&nbsp; There is some difficulty in
detailing the events of this period, for every reader is more or
less acquainted with it, and has viewed it in relation to his own
interests and prejudices.&nbsp; The records of facts are so
voluminous, that every reader may think that there is something
omitted, or misrepresented, or exaggerated.&nbsp; It is
impossible, however, to mention every local occurrence which some
one may think important, every accident, or fire, or crime, or
every grand concert or entertainment.&nbsp; We have to deal with
events more connected with general history; and we shall first
state the more remarkable occurrences of a civil or municipal
character, reserving political matters for a subsequent
chapter.&nbsp; But in order to render our narrative of local
events, and especially local elections, more intelligible, it
will be necessary to give a brief account of the old corporation,
whose proceedings occupy so large a part of our records.</p>
<h4>NORWICH CORPORATION.</h4>
<p>This body claims a prescriptive origin.&nbsp; Certain
privileges were granted to the city by the charters of different
sovereigns, the first being that of Henry I., <a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>which was
annulled and again renewed by Stephen.&nbsp; The particular
privileges conceded by it cannot now be ascertained.&nbsp; The
next charter is that of the 5th Henry II., but this is only
confirmatory of former grants, and the original is still
preserved in the Guildhall.&nbsp; One granted by Richard I.
contains some estimable clauses.&nbsp; The most prominent are,
that no citizen shall be forced to answer any plea or action in
any but the city courts, except for those concerning possessions
out of the city; that the citizens should have <i>acquittance</i>
of <i>murder</i>, which is equivalent to granting them a coroner;
that they should not be forced to <i>duel</i>, that is, should be
exempt from the general law which was then in force, of deciding
causes by single combat; that they should be free from toll
throughout all England; and that they should have other
liberties, all highly important, and no doubt justly appreciated
by the citizens of that period.&nbsp; King John&rsquo;s charter
is similar to the preceding, and that of Henry II., with the
addition that all persons living in the city, and participating
in the liberties of the citizens, shall be talliated or taxed,
and pay as the aforesaid citizens of Norwich do, when tollages
and aid shall be laid upon them.&nbsp; It is probable that the
principal authority was invested in bailiffs, instead of a
provost, in 1223, as there is no evidence of the existence of
such officers before that time.</p>
<p>Two deeds of Henry III., and several of succeeding kings, all
either confirmed or enlarged the privileges granted to the city;
but our attention is most attracted by the concessions of Henry
IV., which established <a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>the constitution of a mayor,
sheriffs, &amp;c.&nbsp; The original charter is lost, but those
of his son and more modern princes have sufficiently preserved
the spirit of it.&nbsp; The charter of Henry V. made the
extensive territory within the corporation limits a county of
itself, excepting only the castle, which belonged to
Norfolk.&nbsp; This territory was, by the boundary act, included
for the purposes of representation.&nbsp; Twenty-five charters,
the latest by James II., are known to have been granted, and
probably others existed and have been lost.&nbsp; When the
innovations, made in old establishments during the Commonwealth,
were gradually reformed, the citizens petitioned for a renewal of
their rights.&nbsp; The charter of 15th Charles II. was obtained,
and under it the city was governed till the passing of the
Municipal Reform Act.&nbsp; Most of the old charters were granted
in consideration for sums of money given or lent to kings to
enable them to carry on wars.&nbsp; Many of the charters were
more injurious than beneficial to the city, as they created
monopolies of one kind or other, or gave powers to the old
corporation which were frequently abused.&nbsp; Those who wish to
study those old documents more minutely may find them in
Blomefield&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>The old corporation was more ornamental than useful to the
city for 400 years.&nbsp; Under it the sanitary state of the city
was so bad, the drainage of the city so defective, and the supply
of water so insufficient, that plagues and pestilences, which
carried off thousands of the citizens, were of frequent
occurrence.&nbsp; Ward elections were so often contested, that <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>bribery,
treating, and intimidation, were quite common, and the corruption
of the freemen and lower classes was universal.&nbsp; Physically
and morally the city was for centuries in the worst possible
condition.&nbsp; The ward elections were carried on with a spirit
which was surpassed in no other place.&nbsp; They were considered
as trials of strength between different parties; and if they
happened at a period when a general election was anticipated, an
enormous sum of money was spent in treating and bribery.&nbsp;
Indeed, it has been asserted on good authority that no less a sum
than &pound;16,000 was wasted in the contest for a single ward in
1818!&nbsp; The city was divided into four great wards, each of
which was subdivided into three small wards.&nbsp; The mayor was
elected by the freemen on May 1st, and sworn into his office on
the Guild day, which was always the Tuesday before Midsummer
day.&nbsp; He was chosen from the aldermen, and afterwards he was
a magistrate for life.&nbsp; One of the sheriffs was chosen by
the court of aldermen, the other by the freemen on the last
Tuesday in August.&nbsp; The twenty-four aldermen were chosen for
the twelve smaller wards, two for each ward, whose office was to
keep the peace in their several divisions.&nbsp; When anyone of
them died, the freemen of that great ward in which the lesser
ward was included, for which he was to serve, elected another in
his place within five days.&nbsp; The common councilmen were
elected by the freemen dwelling in each of the four great wards
separately; for Conisford great ward on the Monday; Mancroft on
the Tuesday; Wymer on the Wednesday; and the Northern ward on <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>the
Thursday in Passion week, thence called &ldquo;cleansing&rdquo;
week.&nbsp; They chose a speaker yearly, who was called speaker
of the commons.&nbsp; The old freemen therefore formed the whole
of the local constituency for municipal purposes.</p>
<p>Memoirs are often the best sources of information respecting
public matters, as they let us behind the scenes and show us what
the actors really thought and did.&nbsp; A good memoir of the
late Professor Taylor, which appeared in the <i>Norfolk News</i>,
of March 28th and April 4th, 1863, contained the following,
&ldquo;So far back as 1808 we find Mr. Taylor recording that he
was &lsquo;elected a common councilman for the fourth
time.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He also states that the contest for
nominees in the Long ward was &ldquo;the severest ever
remembered.&rdquo;&nbsp; Few people now-a-days could realize the
import of those few words.&nbsp; Few understand how much was
implied by the once common phrase &ldquo;a battle for the Long
ward.&rdquo;&nbsp; The combatants would have scorned such
mealy-mouthed appellations, as &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; and
&ldquo;liberal,&rdquo; or indeed any name but that of the colors
under which they fought.&nbsp; They were
&ldquo;blue-and-whites,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;orange-and-purples;&rdquo; the former being what would now
be called the &ldquo;liberal,&rdquo; and the latter the
&ldquo;conservative,&rdquo; party.&nbsp; To be a blue-and-white
or an orange-and-purple, was to be an angel or a devil, as the
case might be; the angels being of course those of your own side,
to whichever you belonged.&nbsp; Great was the potency of colors:
though not supposed to be worn at municipal elections, they were
a rallying cry, and they were always at hand to be flouted, like
<a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>a red
rag at a turkey, in the face of the enemy.&nbsp; Even housemaids
and children concealed them about their persons, in readiness to
show them slyly from some window, both to encourage their friends
and exasperate their enemies, whenever a procession passed.&nbsp;
Great were the preparations for the contest.&nbsp; A sort of
civic press-gang prowled the streets by night for the purpose of
&ldquo;cooping chickens,&rdquo; which, being done into English,
means carrying men off by force, and keeping them drunk and in
confinement, so that if they could not be got to vote
&ldquo;for&rdquo; it would be impossible for them to vote
&ldquo;against.&rdquo;&nbsp; If they could not be safely secured
in the city, they were &ldquo;cribbed, cabined, and
confined&rdquo; in wherries on the river, or the broads, or even
taken to Yarmouth and carried out to sea.&nbsp; When the day of
battle came, great was the shouting, the drinking, the betting,
the bribing, and the fighting, till the longest purse contrived
to win the day.&nbsp; Of course, the dirty work was done by dirty
men.&nbsp; But leading men on both sides were so used to see this
sort of thing, that they considered it only as a necessary part
and parcel of an election.&nbsp; It was regarded rather as a limb
which could not be safely severed from the body, than as a shabby
coat which disgraced the wearer.&nbsp; Besides, palliating
rhetoric was not absent.&nbsp; Better do a little evil than
surrender a cause essential to the welfare of the state!&nbsp;
&ldquo;What we did,&rdquo; we honest orange-and-purples, or we
pure blue-and-whites, &ldquo;was done in mere
self-defence.&rdquo;</p>

Century</span>.</h4>
<p><b>1801</b>.&nbsp; January 1st, 1801, being the first day of
the nineteenth century, and the day on which the Union of Great
Britain and Ireland took place, the 13th Regiment of Light
Dragoons dismounted, and the Militia fired a <i>feu de joie</i>
in the Market Place.</p>
<p>January 3rd.&nbsp; The old Theatre (built in 1757) was
re-opened after extensive improvements.&nbsp; The alterations
were executed after the designs of William Wilkins, Esq., the
patentee.&nbsp; This theatre was formerly a good school for young
actors, and many promising performers have first appeared on
these boards.&nbsp; Of late, operatic performances appear to be
most in favour with the gentry.</p>
<p>February 24th.&nbsp; Charles Harvey, Esq., the steward, was
unanimously elected Recorder of Norwich, vice Henry Partridge,
Esq., resigned.</p>
<p>April 4th.&nbsp; Mrs. Lloyd, widow of the Rev. Dean Lloyd,
died at Cambridge, aged 79.&nbsp; This lady painted the
Transfiguration, and other figures in the eastern windows of the
Cathedral.</p>
<p>In April, the ward elections were the causes of great
contention.&nbsp; In consequence of objections being made to the
elections of two nominees of the Wymer ward, and three of the
Northern ward, on the ground of their being ineligible under the
corporation act, having omitted to receive the sacrament within a
year previous to the election of the common council, the mayor
did not make the returns till several days after the usual <a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>time.&nbsp;
At a court held April 4th, after the objections had been fully
heard by counsel, the recorder (Mr. Harvey) declared that the
persons objected to who had the majority of votes, having omitted
to come into court according to summons, were not duly elected,
but as no regular notice had been given previous to the election,
the candidates in the minority could not be returned.&nbsp; A new
election for the above wards accordingly took place on May 25th
and 26th.</p>
<p>June 16th.&nbsp; Jeremiah Ives, Esq., of Catton, was elected
mayor a second time.&nbsp; There was no guild feast this year at
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.</p>
<p>June 25th.&nbsp; An awful fire, which lasted two hours, broke
out on the roof of the Cathedral, and in less than an hour, 45
feet of the leaded roof, towards the western end of the nave,
were consumed.&nbsp; Some plumbers had been at work repairing the
roof, and set fire to it either accidentally or
intentionally.&nbsp; The damage was about &pound;500.&nbsp; The
Lord Bishop (Dr. Sutton) was present, and distributed refreshment
to the soldiers and people who assisted in arresting the progress
of the conflagration.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1802</b>.&nbsp; Peace was proclaimed throughout the city on
May the 4th, in due form; and the mayor and corporation went in
procession from the hall through the principal streets.&nbsp;
There was a general illumination at night.&nbsp; At a quarterly
assembly of the council, a congratulatory address to his majesty
on the restoration of peace, was voted unanimously.</p>
<p>On May 21st, the city address was presented to the king, at
the levee at St. James&rsquo; Palace, by <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>Jeremiah
Ives, Esq., Junr., the mayor, and Sir Roger Kerrison.</p>
<p>On May 29th, a county meeting was held, when a similar address
was adopted.</p>
<p>October 4th to 7th.&nbsp; A grand musical festival was held in
Norwich, under the direction of Messrs. Beckwith and Sharp of
this city, and Mr. Ashley of London.&nbsp; Mrs. Billington, Mr.
Bartleman, and Mr. Braham, were the principal performers.</p>
<p>October 21st.&nbsp; There was a severe contest for the
election of an alderman in the great northern ward, in the room
of Francis Colombine, Esq., resigned.&nbsp; The numbers
were&mdash;for E. Rigby, Esq., 261; Jonathan Davey, Esq.,
259.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1803</b>.&nbsp; February 8th.&nbsp; At a full meeting held
at the Guildhall, a committee was appointed to prepare a bill to
be laid before a future meeting, for better paving, lighting,
watching, and cleansing the city.&nbsp; A petition to the house
of commons for leave to bring in a bill, was afterwards
presented, but it was strongly opposed as not being then
expedient.&nbsp; An act was, however, ultimately carried.</p>
<p>March 7th.&nbsp; At a special assembly of the corporation, an
address of congratulation was adopted, to be presented to his
majesty, on the providential discovery of the late traitorous
conspiracy against his royal person and government, entered into
by Colonel Despard and six other persons, who were executed on
the top of the New Surrey prison, in Horsemonger Lane.&nbsp; The
high sheriff and grand jury of Norfolk, at <a
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>Thetford,
also voted an address of congratulation to the king, and a
similar address was adopted at a county meeting held at the
Shirehall.</p>
<p>March 21st.&nbsp; The portrait of Captain John Harvey, of the
Norwich Light Horse volunteers, painted by Mr. Opie, at the
request of the troop, was placed in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.</p>
<p>April 27th.&nbsp; A public dispensary was established in
Norwich, and has been a great benefit to the poor people of the
city.</p>
<p>August 16th.&nbsp; France having again threatened to invade
this kingdom, a meeting of the inhabitants of the city was held
at the Guildhall, for the purpose of forming a regiment of
volunteer infantry under the regulations of the Acts for the
defence of the realm, when resolutions to that effect were
adopted, and upwards of &pound;6400 subscribed, and 1400 citizens
enrolled themselves under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Harvey.&nbsp; A rifle corps was also formed, of which R. M.
Bacon, Esq., then editor of the Mercury, was appointed
Captain.&nbsp; Both parties manifested the greatest enthusiasm,
but fortunately the services of the local warriors were not
required.&nbsp; On September 29th, a new telegraph was erected on
the top of Norwich Castle, to communicate with Strumpshaw Mill,
Filby Church, and Yarmouth, so as to give notice of any
danger.&nbsp; In October, the Norfolk and Norwich volunteer
regiments agreed to perform permanent duty at Yarmouth in case of
invasion, and many of them were stationed in the port during the
succeeding two months.&nbsp; The victory of the Norfolk hero,
Lord Nelson, at <a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
326</span>Trafalgar in 1805, discouraged Napoleon I., and he
relinquished his intention to invade this land of freedom.&nbsp;
In July 1806, the local militia act was passed, and many of the
volunteers transferred their services to that body.&nbsp; The
volunteer corps of Norwich and Norfolk were disbanded on March
24th, 1813.&nbsp; The West Norfolk militia returned to Norwich
from Ireland, on May 11th, 1816, and were disembodied on June
17th in that year.&nbsp; A long peace of 40 years ensued, but the
old trade of Norwich destroyed by the war, never revived.&nbsp;
In January, 1817, upwards of &pound;3000 were contributed to
relieve the poor, many of whom were employed in making a new road
to Carrow, and in other public works, the trade of the city being
in a state of stagnation.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1804</b>.&nbsp; January 18th.&nbsp; The city of Norwich
Regiment of Volunteer Infantry, 600 strong, commanded by Lieut.
Col. Harvey, received their colours.&nbsp; The banners, given by
the mayor and corporation, were first consecrated in the Market
Place, by the Rev. E. S. Thurlow, prebendary of Norwich, with a
suitable address and prayer, and were afterwards presented by the
mayor, John Morse, Esq., to the colonel in due form.&nbsp; The
king&rsquo;s and regimental standards were then delivered to the
ensigns.&nbsp; The Artillery, under Capt. Fyers, stationed on the
Castle Hill, fired salutes; the Regiment fired three vollies; and
St. Peter&rsquo;s bells rang merry peals.</p>
<p>June 1st.&nbsp; The city of Norwich (or 7th) Regiment of
Norfolk Volunteer Infantry, commanded by Lieut. <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>Colonel
Harvey, entered on one month&rsquo;s permanent duty in
Norwich.&nbsp; The Regiment mustered 500 strong, exclusive of
officers.</p>
<p>June 4th.&nbsp; The anniversary of His Majesty&rsquo;s
birthday was celebrated in Norwich by the grandest military
spectacle ever witnessed here.&nbsp; Upwards of 1700 men of the
Royal Artillery, 24th Regiment of Foot, and the Norwich Volunteer
Corps, assembled on the Castle Hill and fired a <i>feu de
joie</i> with fine effect.&nbsp; During this year the citizens
were often entertained with military displays.&nbsp; June 18th,
Major General Money was appointed to the staff of the eastern
district; in which a force of 32,000 men was now fully completed
for the reception of any invading enemy.</p>
<p>June 18th.&nbsp; The corporation granted the site of the
Blackfriars, in St. Andrew&rsquo;s, to the court of guardians,
for 200 years at their old rent for the purpose of improving the
same, and repairing the Old Workhouse for the poor, the plan of
erecting a New Workhouse having been abandoned.&nbsp;
Subsequently, large sums of money were wasted in repairing the
old house, sufficient to build a new one, and ultimately it was
found to be absolutely necessary to build a new house, which was
done at a cost of &pound;30,000.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1805</b>.&nbsp; January 17th.&nbsp; At a public meeting
held at the Guildhall, it was resolved to establish an hospital
and school for the indigent blind, in Norwich and Norfolk.&nbsp;
Towards the foundation of this admirable institution, Thomas
Tawell, Esq., contributed a house and three and-a-half acres of
land in Magdalen Street, <a name="page328"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 328</span>valued at &pound;1050.&nbsp; Mr.
Tawell, who was unfortunately blind, introduced his humane
proposal in an able speech, appealing for subscriptions.&nbsp; A
large sum was at once subscribed.&nbsp; The hospital was opened
on the 14th October following.</p>
<p>February 2nd.&nbsp; Dr. Charles Manners Sutton, bishop of
Norwich, was nominated by the king, and chosen, February 12th,
archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; On the 13th, His Grace arrived at
the palace, Norwich, from London.&nbsp; On the 15th, the mayor
and court of aldermen proceeded in state from the Guildhall to
the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace, where the recorder, Mr. Harvey,
delivered an address of congratulation to the archbishop on his
translation, to which His Grace returned a dignified
answer.&nbsp; Next day, the clergy of Norwich waited on His
Grace, when the Rev. Dr. Pretyman, prebendary, addressed the
archbishop in an appropriate speech, to which His Grace made an
impressive reply.&nbsp; On the 17th His Grace preached his
farewell sermon in the Cathedral.</p>
<p>February 24th.&nbsp; The clergy of Norwich having intimated an
intention of applying to Parliament for an increase of their
incomes, then very small, by assessment, the council, at a
quarterly assembly, resolved to oppose the application; the
citizens, in vestry meetings, being unanimous against the
measure, which was never carried out.</p>
<p>March 18th.&nbsp; Dr. Henry Bathurst (one of the prebendaries
of Durham) was elected bishop of Norwich by the dean and
chapter.&nbsp; He soon made himself universally beloved by the
clergy and the <a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span>citizens.&nbsp; Professor Taylor gave the following
account of the late and also of the newly appointed
bishop:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In 1805, Dr. Bathurst succeeded Dr. Sutton
as bishop of Norwich.&nbsp; The latter, who had been translated
to the See of Canterbury, was a man of polished manners,
extravagant habits, and courtier-like address.&nbsp; He was too
polite to quarrel with anybody and too prudent to provoke
controversy.&nbsp; He neither felt nor affected to feel any
horror of Unitarians.&nbsp; He invited them to his table, and at
the request of the mayor, he preached a charity sermon at St.
George&rsquo;s Colegate, knowing that my father had been asked
and had consented to write the hymns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Bathurst removed from Durham to Norwich, and as he
was a stranger in his new residence, never having taken any
prominent part as a public man, little expectation was excited as
to his future conduct.&nbsp; He was known to owe his elevation to
his relation, Lord Bathurst; and it was generally taken for
granted that his views on public affairs were similar to those of
the administration of which that noble lord was a member.&nbsp;
Curiosity led me to the Cathedral to hear the new bishop&rsquo;s
primary charge, and I soon found the spirit it breathed to
resemble the benevolence that beamed from his
countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the bishop preached he also practised.&nbsp; He
never shrunk from appearing to be what he really was, nor while
he received a dissenter in his study with politeness would he
pass him unnoticed in the street.&nbsp; He was to be seen walking
arm-in-arm with persons, of all persuasions, whom he respected,
in the streets of Norwich.&nbsp; He was not afraid of shaking
&lsquo;brother Madge,&rsquo; as he called him, by the hand, nor
of welcoming Unitarians to his table.&nbsp; What he was as a
member of the house of peers, on all occasions in which the <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>great
principles of religious liberty were concerned, is well
known.&nbsp; I have only here to speak of his conduct as a
resident in Norwich.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sept 3rd.&nbsp; The committee of the court of guardians
appointed to examine the poor rates of the city and hamlets, for
the purpose of obtaining a more equal assessment, made their
report, in which they stated that an increase of &pound;16,000
stock and &pound;1800 rent, calculating on the half rental only,
might be made, and recommended a general survey and new valuation
to be taken, in consequence of the great alteration which had
taken place in property since 1786, when the previous survey was
taken.</p>
<p>December 17th.&nbsp; There was a grand entertainment at the
Assembly Rooms, in honour of Lord Nelson&rsquo;s glorious victory
off Cape Trafalgar; more than 450 ladies and gentlemen of the
city and county were present.&nbsp; The rooms were decorated with
transparencies and brilliantly illuminated for a grand ball and
supper.&nbsp; The victory so celebrated, and which had been won
on October 21st, was dearly purchased by the death of Viscount
Nelson.&nbsp; The last order given before the action began, was
by the newly-invented telegraph:&mdash;&ldquo;England expects
every man to do his duty.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1806</b>.&nbsp; January 9th.&nbsp; This day the great bells
of the several churches in the city were tolled from twelve till
two o&rsquo;clock, it being the day on which the remains of the
immortal Lord Nelson were interred under the dome of St.
Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.&nbsp; The body, after lying in state in
the hall of Greenwich Hospital, was brought <a
name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>thence on
January 8th by water to Whitehall stairs, and carried on a bier
to the Admiralty Office, and deposited in the Captain&rsquo;s
room for the night.&nbsp; Next day the corpse was removed on a
funeral car, drawn by six horses, to St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
Duke of York headed the procession, the grandest ever witnessed;
500 persons of distinction attended at the funeral.</p>
<p>February 24th.&nbsp; At a quarterly assembly of the
corporation, a loyal address was unanimously adopted, to be
presented to His Majesty, &ldquo;expressive of their gratitude
for the paternal affection which he has shown to his subjects, by
waiving every consideration, but the public good, in the
appointment of men of the first abilities in the country to the
high offices of state!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1807</b>.&nbsp; March 4th.&nbsp; A committee of the House
of Commons declared Mr. Windham and Mr. Coke not duly elected,
and another election took place for two members for the
county.&nbsp; Sir J. H. Astley, Bart., and Edward Coke, Esq., (of
Derby) were returned without opposition.&nbsp; Mr. Windham
afterwards took his seat for New Romney, and Mr. Coke was
returned for Derby <i>vice</i> his brother, who had previously
accepted the Chiltern Hundreds.</p>
<p>May 14th.&nbsp; The anniversary of the birthday of that
illustrious statesman, the Right Hon. Wm. Windham, was celebrated
at the Angel Inn (now Royal Hotel) by a large party of his
numerous friends.&nbsp; William Smith, Esq., M.P., presided.</p>
<p>June 16th.&nbsp; Robert Herring, Esq., was sworn into <a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>the office
of mayor of Norwich; and he afterwards gave a dinner to 150
gentlemen at Chapel-field house.</p>
<p>October 6th.&nbsp; The first meeting was held of the revived
Norfolk Club at the Angel Inn, Norwich.&nbsp; Sir John Lombe,
Bart., was in the chair.&nbsp; The Hon. Colonel Fitzroy, Mr. W.
Smith, and Mr. Windham were also present.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1808</b>.&nbsp; January.&nbsp; By the telegraph, orders
from the Admiralty Office were received at Yarmouth, in 17
minutes.&nbsp; The chain of communication was by Strumpshaw,
Thorpe Hills, Honingham, Carlton, and Harling, and from thence
proceeded between Thetford and Bury, over Newmarket Heath to
London.</p>
<p>Captain Manby&rsquo;s invention for rescuing persons stranded
on a lee shore, was approved by the Lords of the Admiralty.&nbsp;
Parliament rewarded Captain Manby at different times with grants
amounting to &pound;6000, and adopted his apparatus at many parts
of the coast.</p>
<p>July 29th.&nbsp; At a special assembly of the corporation of
Norwich, an address to his majesty was agreed to unanimously, on
the subject of the noble struggle of the patriots of Spain and
Portugal against the Ruler of France, and of the generous aid
given to their endeavours by the government.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1809</b>.&nbsp; January.&nbsp; In consequence of Colonel
Robert Harvey not being joined by a sufficient number of the
Volunteers under his command to become a local Militia Battalion,
he resigned the command of the <a name="page333"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 333</span>Norwich Volunteer Regiment, and was
succeeded by Colonel De Hague.</p>
<p>May 9th.&nbsp; The six Regiments of Norfolk Local Militia
first assembled to perform 28 days&rsquo; exercise.&nbsp; They
were stationed at Norwich, Yarmouth, Swaffham, and Lynn.</p>
<p>October 15th.&nbsp; The Norwich corn merchants demanded of the
farmers a month&rsquo;s credit, instead of paying ready money for
their corn as heretofore, but it was resisted by the growers, and
ultimately abandoned by the merchants.</p>
<p>November 2nd.&nbsp; After an interval of seven years, there
was a grand musical festival here, combining oratorios at St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church, and concerts at the Theatre, under the
direction of Mr. Beckwith, eldest son of the late Dr.
Beckwith.&nbsp; Professor Hague, of Cambridge, led the band.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1810</b>.&nbsp; January 20th.&nbsp; The disputes between
the corn growers and buyers in the city and county, having been
amicably adjusted, a reconciliation dinner took place at the
Maid&rsquo;s Head Inn.&nbsp; Amongst the toasts was, &ldquo;Fair

of his advanced age and infirmities, there was no dinner in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, on the guild-day.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Davey
(who was one of the unsuccessful candidates for the office of
mayor on May 1st and 2nd) gave a dinner under the trees adjoining
his house at Eaton, to about 500 freemen of the liberal
interest.&nbsp; Strange as it may seem now, contests often took
place for the office of mayor, during the old corporation.</p>
<p>July 17th.&nbsp; At a meeting of noblemen, gentry, and clergy,
held at the Shirehall, (Lord Viscount Primrose in the chair,) the
Norfolk and Norwich Society for the education of the poor in the

office of Mayor of Norwich came on, and was not finished till
next morning, when Alderman Davey and J. Harvey were returned as
the two highest; but on May 3rd, an objection was made to
Alderman J. Harvey, <a name="page336"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 336</span>as being ineligible, from his not
being a resident inhabitant of the city, as required by
charter.&nbsp; Counsel&rsquo;s opinion was obtained in favour of
that objection, and another election took place on June 7th, when
another contest ensued, and after a spirited poll the numbers
were&mdash;for Alderman Leman, 797; Alderman Davey, 801.&nbsp;
The Court of Aldermen elected the former gentleman.</p>
<p>July 4th.&nbsp; Great rejoicings took place here on the
arrival of the news of the great victory obtained by the British
army commanded by the Marquis of Wellington, over the French
army, under Joseph Buonaparte, at Vittoria in Spain, on June

principal streets.</p>
<p>June 8th.&nbsp; The Newmarket mail arrived in Norwich with
news of the Corn Importation Bill having been thrown out of the

mayor and corporation went in a procession of carriages from the
Guildhall through the principal streets, preceded by trumpets,
and accompanied by thousands of people.</p>
<p>July 7th.&nbsp; The thanksgiving day for the happy restoration
of peace.&nbsp; The mayor and corporation attended divine service
at the Cathedral.&nbsp; About 700 children from the church
schools went in procession to St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, where a
plentiful dinner of roast beef and plum pudding was provided for
them by the treasurers of the charity schools.&nbsp; The poor in
their several parishes participated in the general joy, and were
regaled with plentiful dinners, paid for by subscriptions.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1815</b>.&nbsp; March 4th.&nbsp; The late Professor Taylor
stood a contest, for the third time, for nominee of St.
Peter&rsquo;s Mancroft ward.&nbsp; Of course he was beaten, this
being an orange-and-purple ward, but he polled 107 votes.&nbsp;
However, he was soon afterwards elected a common councilman,
without difficulty, in the Northern ward, <a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>where the
blue-and-whites had always a large majority.&nbsp; This was on
March 16th, and on May 3rd he was elected a member of the court
of guardians.&nbsp; He took a very active part in local politics,
and was the first man who ever reported and published the
proceedings of the common council.</p>
<p>June 23rd.&nbsp; The glorious news was received in Norwich,
with triumphant rejoicings, of the ever memorable victory
obtained by the Duke of Wellington over the French army,
commanded by Buonaparte in person, at Waterloo, near Brussels, on
the 18th.&nbsp; Buonaparte fled to Paris, leaving upwards of 200
pieces of cannon in the hands of the allied armies.</p>
<p>June 27th.&nbsp; Rejoicings were renewed here on the news
being received of the second abdication of Buonaparte, the
immediate consequence of the grand victory of La Belle
Alliance.</p>

made for the poor.</p>

meetings were also held to petition against the tax.</p>
<p>March 29th.&nbsp; At a public meeting held at the Guildhall,
Norwich, with the mayor in the chair, it was resolved to
establish a bank for savings, where servants and others might

<p>April 3rd.&nbsp; A meeting of merchants, manufacturers, and
others, was held at the Guildhall, Norwich, John Harvey, Esq.,

name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>presidency

<p>May 11th.&nbsp; The West Norfolk militia returned to Norwich
from Ireland, and were disembodied on the 17th of June.</p>
<p>May 16th.&nbsp; A number of riotous persons, chiefly youths,
broke into the New Mills, in Norwich, threw some of the flour
into the mill pool, and committed several outrages on persons and
dwellings before they dispersed.&nbsp; The pretext for the
disturbance was the want of employment.&nbsp; They assembled
again on the next evening, but were dispersed by the magistrates
and military, and several of the rioters were taken into
custody.&nbsp; Similar proceedings took place at Downham and
other places in Norfolk.</p>
<p>June 17th.&nbsp; At a quarterly assembly of the corporation,

certain resolutions, and a petition to parliament founded
thereon, were agreed to.&nbsp; The petition was for the greatest
possible retrenchment of the public expenditure, and for a Reform

movement, and it continued to extend all over the country.&nbsp;
It became stronger and stronger, till at last it overcame all
opposition.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1817</b>.&nbsp; January 1st.&nbsp; At a public meeting in
the Guildhall, with the mayor, William Hankes, Esq., presiding, a
subscription was commenced to relieve the labouring poor, which
amounted to &pound;3050.&nbsp; The poor people were employed on
works of public improvement, and were supplied with soup,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Upwards of &pound;1000 was also raised at Yarmouth
for the same laudable purpose, and 460 men were employed in
forming roads to the Bath House, Jetty, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
committee in Norwich granted &pound;270 to be expended for labour
on cutting a road through Butter Hills to Carrow Bridge, which
was effected in the course of the summer.</p>
<p>March 26th.&nbsp; The severest contest took place ever <a
name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>known for
nominees of Wymer, or the Long ward, very few votes remaining
unpolled.&nbsp; Some of the freemen came in post-chaises from
Thetford to poll.&nbsp; The numbers were, Messrs. S. Mitchell,
306; J. Reynolds, 305; A. Thwaites, 292; Messrs. W. Foster, 297;

<p>April 4th.&nbsp; On Good Friday morning, Wright&rsquo;s
Norwich and Yarmouth steam packet had just started from the
Foundry Bridge, when the boiler of the engine burst with a
tremendous explosion, by which the vessel was blown to atoms, and
of 22 persons on board, five men three women, and one child were
instantly killed.&nbsp; Six women with fractured arms and legs
were conveyed to the hospital, where one died.&nbsp; The
remaining seven escaped without much injury.&nbsp; A subscription
amounting to &pound;350 was raised for the sufferers.&nbsp; Soon
afterwards, a packet was introduced on the river, worked by four
horses, as in a thrashing machine; the animals walking in a path
18 feet in diameter.&nbsp; The vessel was propelled from six to
seven miles an hour, as wind and tide favoured.&nbsp; This packet
did not long run, and steam packets were again introduced, which
went from Norwich to Yarmouth daily.</p>
<p>September 26th.&nbsp; A meeting was held in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall, when an auxiliary association to the London Society for
Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews was established.&nbsp;
The Lord Bishop of Norwich was appointed president.&nbsp; Annual
meetings <a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><b>1818</b>.&nbsp; January 5th.&nbsp; The court of guardians
having determined to proceed in the valuation of the property in
the city and hamlets, Messrs. Rook, Athow, and Stannard were
appointed to make such valuation.&nbsp; They were to be paid
&pound;850 for their trouble.</p>
<p>A repository was established in Norwich for the sale of
articles of ingenuity, to increase the funds of the society for
relieving the sick poor in Norwich.&nbsp; The first exhibition
took place on Tombland fair day, at Mr. Noverre&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>March 11th.&nbsp; This year, the several wards in Norwich
(except the Northern ward) were strongly contested, particularly
the Wymer ward.&nbsp; After a spirited poll for nominees of the
common council, the numbers were for Mr. Foster, 361; Mr. Higgen,
357; Mr. Purland, 355; Mr. Mitchell, 345; Mr. Culley, 340; Mr.
Beckwith, 322.&nbsp; The liberal party at last obtained the
ascendancy, but had to pay for it.&nbsp; The expenditure at this
local contest was estimated at some thousands.&nbsp; From
&pound;15 to &pound;40 were given for votes, and the freemen were
brought in carriages from the country.</p>
<p>May 16th.&nbsp; This being Guild-day, Barnabas Leman, <a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>Esq., was
sworn in mayor of Norwich for the second time.&nbsp; The
corporation went in procession to the Cathedral, preceded by the
Blue and White Clubs, the freemen wearing those colours in their
hats, which was considered improper and ill-timed.&nbsp; Mr.
William Smith, before the procession started, after recommending
his friends to abstain from this display of party feeling on such
a day, pulled his colours from his hat and put them in his
pocket.&nbsp; It being quite a matter of taste, his example was
not followed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1819</b>.&nbsp; This year some important meetings were
held, and a good deal of political excitement prevailed in the
city.&nbsp; Mr. E. Taylor was elected sheriff after a contest
with Mr. T. S. Day.&nbsp; The former was evidently the popular
candidate, the numbers being for Taylor 807, for Day 530.&nbsp;
In acknowledging the honour which had been conferred upon him he
said,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are times, gentlemen, when the post
of honour is the post of duty&mdash;times when it is the duty of
every man to stand forward to maintain and uphold the laws of his
country, and prevent them from being outraged.&nbsp; Such,
gentlemen, are the present.&nbsp; Scenes have recently been
exhibited in a distant part of this country which I blush to
mention.&nbsp; The laws have there been outraged and trodden
under foot, not by the people, but by the magistrates, whose duty
it was to protect them.&nbsp; At Manchester we have seen a
merciless soldiery, or rather, I should say, persons wearing red
coats, and pretending to be soldiers, let loose to butcher men,
women, and children in cold blood who were peaceably and legally
met to discharge a duty which they owed to their <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>country.&nbsp; The right of petitioning is a right
which, till lately, we have enjoyed uninterruptedly, none daring
to make us afraid; and where is the man who will tell me that
these people did not legally and constitutionally meet?&nbsp;
But, gentlemen, they have been treated in a manner so brutal and
inhuman, that our history furnishes no parallel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He alluded to the &ldquo;Peterloo Massacre&rdquo; as it was
then called, and which excited universal indignation throughout
the country.</p>
<p>January 25th.&nbsp; The birthday of Mr. Fox was commemorated,
by nearly 250 gentlemen, at the Assembly rooms.&nbsp; The earl of
Albemarle presided, supported by Mr. Coke and Viscount
Bury.&nbsp; The high sheriff was at the head of the right hand
table, and Mr. Wm. Smith of the left.&nbsp; After dinner,
speeches were delivered, setting forth the views of the Liberal
party.</p>
<p>April 15th.&nbsp; A public meeting was held in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, when a petition to the House of Commons
against the duty on coals (6s. 6d. per chaldron) was adopted by
acclamation.&nbsp; R. H. Gurney, Esq., M.P., assured the meeting
that he should support the prayer of the petition, and do
everything in his power towards alleviating the burdens of his
fellow-citizens.&nbsp; The tax was ultimately abolished.</p>
<p>April 22nd.&nbsp; The duke of Sussex arrived in Norwich and
lodged at the house of William Foster, Esq., in Queen Street,
where his royal highness was waited upon by the mayor and
corporation.&nbsp; Mr. Steward Alderson, in an address of
congratulation on his arrival, informed his royal highness that
the whole body corporate had voted to him the freedom of the <a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>city, which
the royal duke was pleased to accept, at the same time returning
a dignified answer.&nbsp; On the next day a grand meeting of the
Masonic brethren, 320 in number, was held in Chapel-field
house.&nbsp; The large Assembly room was decorated in the most
splendid style.&nbsp; At 10.30 a.m., the duke of Sussex (as grand
master of England) installed Thomas Wm. Coke, Esq., M.P., as
provincial grand master, with the accustomed Masonic
ceremonies.&nbsp; His royal highness delivered an impressive
charge, on investing Mr. Coke with the jewel, apron, and
gloves.&nbsp; After this ceremony a procession was formed, every
officer and member of the assembled lodges wearing his full
masonic costume and jewels, and the banners were carried in the
procession to the Cathedral.&nbsp; In the evening, there was a
sumptuous banquet in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, at which the royal
duke presided, supported by Mr. Coke and I. Ives, Esq., the
deputy provincial grand master.&nbsp; About 254 persons dined,
and many ladies were present to witness the festive scene.&nbsp;
Toasts were proposed in right royal style, and duly responded
to.&nbsp; Next day His Royal Highness was admitted to the
honorary freedom of the city at the Guildhall, where he took the
customary oaths.&nbsp; After visiting the exhibition of the
Artists&rsquo; Society, the royal duke left Norwich about noon
and proceeded to Holkham, paying a visit to Sir George
Jerningham, at Cossey Hall, on his way thither.</p>
<p>May 28th.&nbsp; The anniversary of the birthday of the Rt.
Hon. Wm. Pitt was commemorated at the Assembly rooms, Norwich, by
a very numerous company of noblemen, gentlemen, and citizens.</p>

4th.&nbsp; The anniversary of the birthday of the long afflicted
sovereign, George III., who had entered on the eighty-second year
of his age, was celebrated for the last time in Norwich,
Yarmouth, Lynn, and other towns, with the accustomed
demonstration of loyalty and attachment.</p>
<p>July 15th.&nbsp; Meetings were held in Norwich, and
resolutions were passed, and petitions to parliament adopted,
against the proposed additional duties on malt and on foreign
wool.&nbsp; Petitions were also presented to parliament praying
for an alteration in the corn laws, in consequence of the
depressed state of agriculture.</p>
<p>September 16th.&nbsp; A public meeting was held in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, in order to take into consideration the late
disastrous transactions at Manchester, on August 16th.&nbsp; The
mayor, R. Bolingbroke, Esq., presided, when resolutions were
adopted asserting the right of the subject to petition the king,
and the legality of the late meeting at Manchester, censuring the
conduct of the magistrates and yeomanry, and recommending a
subscription for the relief of the sufferers.&nbsp; An address to
the prince regent was agreed to for the removal of ministers from
his presence and councils for ever.&nbsp; The address was
afterwards presented by the city members.</p>
<p>October 18th.&nbsp; A public meeting was held by adjournment
at the Guildhall to take into consideration the propriety of
erecting a bridge over the river, near the Duke&rsquo;s Palace,
to connect Pitt Street with the Market Place.&nbsp; A proposition
to that effect was <a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>negatived, but a bill for erecting the bridge was
introduced into parliament and ultimately passed.&nbsp; Nearly
&pound;9,000 were proposed to be raised, by shares of &pound;25
each, to complete the same.&nbsp; The bridge was built in course
of time, and toll had to be paid for many years.&nbsp; By the
exertions and influence of the late T. O. Springfield, Esq., the
bridge was made a free thoroughfare, greatly to the convenience
of the citizens.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1820</b>.&nbsp; January 5th.&nbsp; At a special meeting of
the Diocesan Committee of the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge, held in Norwich, (the Lord Bishop presiding)
resolutions were adopted to counteract the evil effects of
infidel and blasphemous publications, by issuing tracts of the
Parent Society at very reduced prices, and a subscription was
entered into for that purpose.</p>
<p>January 24th.&nbsp; The anniversary of the birthday of the
Right Hon. C. J. Fox was commemorated by a grand public dinner in
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall by 460 noblemen and gentlemen, amongst
whom were the Duke of Sussex, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of
Albemarle (who presided), Viscount Bury, Lord Molyneux, and many
other leading gentlemen of the liberal party.&nbsp; The hall was
handsomely decorated, and the names of <span
class="smcap">Fox</span> and <span class="smcap">Albemarle</span>
appeared in variegated lamps, and in a semi-circular transparency
was that of <span class="smcap">Sussex</span>, in letters of gold
upon a ground of purple silk.</p>
<p>January 30th.&nbsp; A messenger from London brought to Lord
and Lady Castlereagh (who were at Gunton <a
name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 349</span>Hall) the
melancholy tidings of the death of King George III., which became
known in Norwich on the following morning, when nearly all the
shops were closed, and the bells of the churches were tolled for
three hours.&nbsp; The king died on January 29th, in the 82nd
year of his age, and the 60th of his troubled reign, during which
long wars desolated Europe, doubled our national debt, and
impoverished the country.&nbsp; His Royal Highness, the Prince of
Wales, (who was appointed regent on February 6th, 1811,)
immediately ascended the throne.&nbsp; King George IV. was soon
afterwards seriously indisposed with inflammation in the lungs,
but happily recovered from the attack in the course of a
week.</p>
<p>February 1st.&nbsp; King George IV. was proclaimed on the
Castle Hill by the High Sheriff, Sir William Windham Dalling,
Bart., amid the cheers of those assembled.&nbsp; On the same day
His Majesty was proclaimed in the city in full form and with
great rejoicings.</p>
<p>March 6th.&nbsp; A spirited contest took place for the gown,
vacant by the death of Starling Day, Esq., alderman of Wymer
ward.&nbsp; At the close of the poll the numbers were for Henry
Francis, Esq., 413; John Lovick, Esq., 372; majority for Mr.
Francis 41, who was declared duly elected.&nbsp; In this month
Messrs. Mitchell, Beckwith, and Culley were elected nominees for
the long ward without opposition.&nbsp; The other three wards
were contested.&nbsp; After the elections for Wymer and the
Northern wards, processions took place at night to celebrate the
triumph of the two contending parties.</p>
<p><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>August 2nd.&nbsp; A common hall was held for the
purpose of getting up an address to be presented to Queen
Caroline.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Leman presided, and Mr. Sheriff
Taylor introduced the subject, declaring that their duty was not
merely to vote an address to Her Majesty on her accession, but to
protest against the proceedings adopted by His Majesty&rsquo;s
ministers, against her &ldquo;whom we ought to honour as our
Queen, and esteem as a woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; He denied the
imputation that this meeting was held for factious and seditious
purposes.&nbsp; He reviewed the various charges which had been
brought against Her Majesty, and mentioned several instances of
noble conduct on her part.&nbsp; He regarded the erasure of her
name from the liturgy as a gross insult, and spoke of the
firmness, and sagacity, and judgment which characterised her
determination to return to England.&nbsp; He reminded his hearers
of the enthusiasm which attended her entry into London.&nbsp; But
no sooner was she arrived than a large green bag was laid on the
table.&nbsp; Now he had an instinctive horror of a green bag, as
he had once the honour of occupying a small corner of one.&nbsp;
He then challenged the ministers, through Mr. Coke, to prove any
one of the charges brought against him in the green bag; and he
received an answer that it was all a mistake, and that Norwich
should not have been inserted.&nbsp; The resolutions were carried
by acclamation, and he afterwards presented an address to the
Queen at Brandenburgh house.</p>
<p>There was but one opinion here as to the character of George
IV., and with respect to the Queen, all the <a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>world
agreed that she was much to be pitied.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s passions
were so strongly excited, that whichever side they took, whether
for her or against her, her conduct was viewed through a false
medium.&nbsp; Nothing showed this more strongly than the
behaviour of the two parties upon her death.&nbsp; The
blue-and-whites, many of whom had never put on black for a royal
personage before, were to be seen dressed in black and white,
while on the other hand the orange-and-purples, not content with
appearing in their ordinary attire, flaunted about in the gayest
colours.</p>
<p>December 12th.&nbsp; In consequence of the numerous robberies
committed in the city and county, public meetings were held, and
resolutions passed to grant high rewards to watchmen who might
apprehend offenders.&nbsp; More burglaries had been committed in
that year than in the preceding twenty years.&nbsp; Increased
poverty had produced crime, and the &ldquo;Old Charlies&rdquo;
were of little use.</p>

<p>July 27th.&nbsp; The coronation of George IV. was celebrated
here in a very splendid manner, and <a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>gave occasion for a display of the
exuberant loyalty of the citizens.&nbsp; This king, called
&ldquo;the finest gentleman in Europe,&rdquo; had governed the
realm for nearly ten years, and visited the city in 1812.&nbsp;
His reign was peaceful and prosperous, and he was a great
promoter of the arts and sciences.&nbsp; The most important event
of his reign was the passing of the act for Roman Catholic
emancipation, by which Roman Catholics became entitled to all the
rights and privileges enjoyed by the rest of the community, a
measure strongly supported here by the liberal party.&nbsp;
During this reign the citizens of Norwich took a very active part
in all the great movements of the age&mdash;the Roman Catholic
Emancipation movement, the Anti-Slavery movement, and the Reform
agitation.&nbsp; Strong contests at elections took place on all
these questions.&nbsp; Bribery, corruption, treating, cooping,
and intimidation, were resorted to by both parties on every
occasion, as will appear in a subsequent chapter, on our
political history.&nbsp; Party spirit never ran higher in any
town than in Norwich.</p>

by Mr. Edward Taylor, Mr. R. M. Bacon, then editor of the
<i>Mercury</i>, and other amateurs in the city, and proved
eminently successful, the hospital receiving the sum of
&pound;2,399 out of the profits.&nbsp; In 1825, King George IV.
presented the hospital with a copy of Arnold&rsquo;s edition of
Handel&rsquo;s Works.&nbsp; It was determined that a triennial
festival should be held in aid of the funds of the institution,
and that the Norwich Choral Society should be maintained in an
efficient state for that purpose.</p>
<h3><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
Norwich Navigation.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> this time a very important
movement took place in the city, with the view to make
&ldquo;Norwich a port,&rdquo; and many meetings were held to
promote that object.&nbsp; Here, therefore, will be a proper
place to review the proceedings in reference to our navigation to
Yarmouth and Lowestoft.&nbsp; The history will show the grasping
selfishness of the old corporation at Yarmouth, which always
tried to tax the trade of the city, and opposed every
improvement, even when it was for the benefit of both towns.</p>
<p>Norwich, no doubt, derived its mercantile and carrying trade
from its original situation as a sea-port.&nbsp; In ancient times
the <i>Gariensis Ostium</i>, or mouth of the Yare, extended in
breadth from Burgh Castle to Caister, the two Roman camps being
opposite each other.&nbsp; The spot on which Yarmouth now stands
was then covered by water, and a broad arm of the sea extended
all over the present marshes to the city, which was then a
sea-port, before Yarmouth had any existence.&nbsp; This appears
from the legal contests that <a name="page358"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 358</span>took place in later times between
the burgesses of Yarmouth and the citizens of Norwich.</p>
<p>Norwich had long been a mercantile and trading town, and one
of the royal cities of England, and ships came up by an arm of
the sea to an open market, which was held every day in the
week.&nbsp; Public marts or fairs were held twice a year, with
all manner of merchandise for sale to citizens, strangers, or
foreigners.&nbsp; The traders for centuries used this right of
buying and selling, loading and unloading all their goods and
merchandise, free of all tolls and dues.&nbsp; Foreign merchants
paid at Norwich 4d. on every ship of bulk, 2d. for every boat,
and all other customs for their merchandise.</p>
<p>At the commencement of the 14th century Yarmouth began to be a
rival port to Norwich, and some legal contests took place between
the two towns respecting their rights and privileges.&nbsp; In
1327, a suit was commenced, and in 1331 it was renewed, between
the citizens of Norwich and the burgesses of Yarmouth, relating
to certain tolls which the latter imposed on goods, claiming the
right to do so under the charter of Edward I., which made
Yarmouth a port.&nbsp; Indeed, they appear to have been so
incensed at the city becoming a staple that they proceeded so far
as to stop all vessels coming through from their port to
Norwich.&nbsp; A very remarkable contest consequently arose, and
terminated in favour of the city.&nbsp; The result of the suit
was, that the bailiffs of Yarmouth were commanded to make
proclamation in their town, &ldquo;That if any hindered or in any
way molested the <a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
359</span>merchant vessels of what kind soever from passing and
re-passing through the port of Yarmouth, to and from the city of
Norwich, they should forfeit all their goods and chattels,
forfeitable, for so doing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yarmouth was, therefore,
prevented for a time from levying duties, but subsequently
regained the power of doing so to a great extent.</p>
<p>If Norwich in former ages was an important seaport, the
question naturally arises how it ceased to be so.&nbsp; There is
sufficient evidence that after the year 500, the arm of the sea
became narrower, though at that period the water came up close to
the Castle Hill.&nbsp; After 1050, the river was much reduced in
breadth, and a new town arose round the fortress.&nbsp; Centuries
elapsed and the river became still narrower, and streets were
extended on each side.&nbsp; At length the stream became so
shallow that it was no longer navigable for sea-borne vessels,
and the ancient trade of the city began to decline.&nbsp; The
citizens, occupied by political contests, did not keep up the
navigation for sea-borne vessels, as they might easily have
done.&nbsp; Attempts were made in this (19th) century to retrieve
the long neglect of former ages by some schemes of improvement,
but these attempts almost entirely failed.&nbsp; Still the city
owed many trading advantages to its river, which is navigable for
wherries and packets to the sea.</p>
<p>The navigation between Norwich and Yarmouth has not been, for
centuries, suited for sea-borne vessels, owing, chiefly, to the
shallowness of the channel over Breydon.&nbsp; The embouchure of
the river into the sea <a name="page360"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 360</span>has been frequently blocked up by
shifting sands, and vessels have been detained fourteen days
before they could get into the river.&nbsp; Indeed, at the
present time there is great danger of the mouth of the harbour
being blocked up at Yarmouth altogether.</p>
<p>Prior to the year 1762, the quantity of coals brought from
Yarmouth to Norwich, annually, was 26,000 chaldrons.&nbsp; Of
these, nearly 5000 chaldrons were carried out of Norwich into the
surrounding district, so that 21,000 chaldrons were consumed in
the city.&nbsp; At that time, the king&rsquo;s dues and the
Yarmouth dues amounted to 8s. 1d. per chaldron, which was felt by
the consumers to be a grievous tax.&nbsp; A cheap and plentiful
supply of coal has always been of the utmost importance to the
citizens, not only for domestic purposes, but also as fuel for
manufacturers, dyers, hot pressers, lime burners, brewers, and
maltsters.&nbsp; Yet, at the period referred to, this necessary
commodity was heavily taxed, to the extent of &pound;1200 yearly,
more than was paid on an equal consumption in London.&nbsp; This
tax was rendered more grievous by the illegal measurement at
Yarmouth.&nbsp; The legal chaldron consisted of thirty-six
bushels; but, at Yarmouth the chaldron was estimated not by
bushels, but by a measure called a mett, sixteen of which were
computed to contain a chaldron, but did not.&nbsp; As may be
supposed, the injustice naturally caused considerable
dissatisfaction among the Norwich coal merchants and other
citizens, and frequent complaints were made of the grievance
which was ultimately abolished.&nbsp; This was important, for
formerly, from <a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
361</span>the north of England, immense quantities of coal and
heavy goods were brought by sea, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Yarmouth to
Norwich, for distribution over the eastern side of Norfolk and
Suffolk.&nbsp; The importation of coal, by this route, has,
however, been greatly diminished; not only by the opening of
railways in every direction, but also by the working of the
central coal fields of England.</p>
<p>By the act of the 12th George I., c. 15, commonly called the
Tonnage Act, the corporation obtained the power to levy tolls on
all goods brought into the city by any boat, keel wherry,
lighter, buoy, or other vessel as follows:&mdash;4d. for every
chaldron of coals, for every last of wheat, rye, barley, malt, or
other grain, for every weight of salt, for every hogshead of
sugar, tobacco, molasses, or hogshead packed with other goods,
for every three puncheons of liquor, for every two pipes of wine,
spirits, &amp;c., for every eight barrels of soap, raisins, oil,
pitch, tar, &amp;c.&nbsp; For five years prior to May, 1836, the
average amount of revenue derived from the tonnage dues was
&pound;970, showing that a very large quantity of goods was
brought by river to the city.&nbsp; After June 24th, 1836, the
tolls were let by auction for &pound;1375; in 1838, for
&pound;1210; in 1840, for &pound;1220; in 1847, for &pound;1000;
in 1850, for &pound;1050 yearly.&nbsp; This shows that after the
opening of railways the dues were reduced, but not so much as
might have been expected; the wherries continued to bring in a
large proportion of the heavy goods.</p>
<p>The project of opening a communication between Norwich and the
sea, for sea-borne vessels, originated <a
name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>with
Alderman Crisp Brown, who in 1814, submitted to the corporation a
plan for making Norwich a port by way of Yarmouth.&nbsp; After
this, surveys were made, and a report was published in 1818, by
Mr. Cubitt, who recommended avoiding Breydon by a new cut on the
south side.&nbsp; In the same year he made another survey, to
ascertain the practicability of opening a communication with the
sea at Lowestoft, and in 1821 this report was laid before the
public.&nbsp; As the Yarmouth corporation had signified their
determination to oppose either of these plans, it was at length
determined to carry out the communication to Lowestoft, although
the expense was double that of the Yarmouth plan.&nbsp; This
turned out to be a very unfortunate undertaking.&nbsp;
Subscriptions were raised and fresh surveys were made; and in
1826, a company having been formed, an application was made to
Parliament for an Act; but being opposed by the Yarmouth
corporation and timid owners of the marsh lands, who were fearful
of an inundation, it was lost by a majority of five.&nbsp; This
act, however, was finally passed in 1827, after &pound;8000 had
been spent by the corporation of Yarmouth in opposing it.&nbsp;
Of course, the object of that body was to retain the monopoly of
the Norwich trade, which was then very great.</p>
<p>On May 23rd, 1827, the bill for making Norwich a port having
been passed through both houses of Parliament, the navigation
committee, with the mayor (their chairman), were met at Hartford
Hill, on their return from London, by thousands of their
fellow-citizens who were assembled to welcome them; and <a
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>a grand
procession having been formed, they marched through the city,
while guns were fired in all directions.&nbsp; The celebration
concluded with a bonfire at night.</p>
<p>In effecting the great undertaking of a communication with
Lowestoft, the river Yare was deepened near Norwich and the
navigation was continued by that river as far as Reedham, whence
it was carried across the marshes by a new cut, two miles and
a-half long, to the river Waveney, along which it passed to
Oulton Dyke, which was widened and deepened to Oulton Broad,
whence by a short cut the canal entered Lake Lothing, through
which it passed to the shore at Lowestoft, where, by cutting
through the bank, the tides were freely admitted into the
lake.&nbsp; Here a large harbour was formed, covering 160 acres,
nearly three miles in length, and averaging from fifteen to
seventeen feet in depth at high water.&nbsp; In this work the
company spent their whole capital of &pound;150,000.</p>
<p>On September 30th, 1833, the Norwich and Lowestoft navigation
was opened, when two vessels came from the latter place and
arrived at the wharfs without once touching ground.&nbsp; This
caused great rejoicing, and the advantages of the undertaking
were soon apparent.&nbsp; But the company wanted money, and were
obliged to borrow it from the Exchequer Loan Commissioners, into
whose hands the port fell in 1842.&nbsp; Norwich traders might
afterwards have recovered possession of the port for a small sum
by a combined effort, but they lost the opportunity.&nbsp; The
commissioners disposed of the port and navigation to a new
company at Lowestoft, and that company, after expending <a
name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>large sums
in repairs, sold the harbour and navigation to Mr. Peto for
almost a nominal price.&nbsp; He, with other gentlemen, organised
another company, raised a capital of &pound;200,000 (afterwards
doubled), and obtained an act of parliament for the formation of
a new harbour, and a railway to Reedham in connection with the
line to Norwich.&nbsp; The new harbour was made, and the railway
was opened in 1847, from which year the carrying trade of the
port gradually increased.&nbsp; Before 1850 the importation of
coal and the harbour dues increased five-fold, and the
importations of corn increased 10,000 quarters yearly.&nbsp; The
number of vessels was doubled, and of course employment increased
in proportion.&nbsp; The harbour and railway contributed a large
traffic to the Eastern Counties lines.&nbsp; Norwich traders made
great use of the port, and through it brought quantities of coal
and heavy goods to the city.&nbsp; There is every mechanical
facility afforded for the loading and unloading of vessels; and
port dues are lower than at Yarmouth.&nbsp; In 1851, the number
of vessels that entered the harbour was 1,636, or 131,767 tons,
showing an increase of 23,000 tons.&nbsp; In the same year there
was an increase of 6,997 tons in the coal imported.&nbsp; Of
course, as the shipping trade of the port increased, the railway
traffic increased also.&nbsp; One of the chief sources from which
the additional revenue was derived was from the fish traffic; for
in 1851 the packages were 78,000 in number, and produced a
freight of &pound;3,739.&nbsp; The traffic also in coal and goods
has greatly improved.</p>
<p>Between 1840 and 1850 the corporation of Norwich, <a
name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>aided by
the city merchants, made a most determined effort to improve the
navigation to Yarmouth.&nbsp; A large subscription was raised for
this purpose, and Mr. Cockburn Curtiss, the engineer, was engaged
to make a survey of the river Yare, and to prepare plans.&nbsp;
He did so, and his plans were approved by the citizens generally;
but the corporation of Yarmouth gave notice of a strong
opposition.&nbsp; Application was made to parliament for a bill
giving the corporation here jurisdiction over the river down to
the mouth of the Haven.&nbsp; The bill was opposed and lost, and
the Norwich corporation were defeated after an expenditure of
some thousands of pounds.</p>

was adopted unanimously.&nbsp; The petition afterwards received
14,385 signatures, and was forwarded on the 26th to be presented
to parliament.&nbsp; As yet it was not proposed to <i>repeal</i>
the Corn Laws, which were then a monstrous injustice.</p>
<p><a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>May
1st.&nbsp; The election for mayor took place, and the numbers

perpetuate a great wrong.</p>
<p>May 31st.&nbsp; The anniversary of the birthday of the Rt.
Hon. William Pitt was celebrated by the members of the castle
corporation.</p>
<p>June 11th.&nbsp; The first stone of the new theatre was laid,
and it was erected on the present site.&nbsp; The building is
only a piece of patch-work, and has no pretensions to
architectural design.&nbsp; It is no credit to the city in any
respect.&nbsp; It was opened on March 27th, in the following
year.</p>
<p>June 21st.&nbsp; The mayor (T. S. Day, Esq.,) was sworn into
office; he afterwards gave a dinner to upwards of 460 gentlemen

<p>November 21st.&nbsp; At a public meeting, held in St. Andrews
Hall, a Society was formed for promoting the Abolition of
Colonial Slavery.&nbsp; The late J. J. Gurney and all his family
were great advocates of negro emancipation, but the diabolical
injustice of slavery continued for many years to be the disgrace
of England.&nbsp; At many meetings held in this city, the late J.
J. Gurney denounced the atrocities of the slave trade, and
advocated its abolition.&nbsp; This object was at last
accomplished after a violent agitation throughout the country, at
a cost of twenty millions sterling!</p>

opposition, and Mr. E. T. Booth was elected.</p>
<p>May 30th.&nbsp; The anniversary of Mr. William Pitt&rsquo;s
birthday was again celebrated by the members of the castle
corporation.&nbsp; The dinners of this and other clubs served to

379</span>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
The Reform Era.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span> IV. ascended the throne in
1830, in a period of great political excitement.&nbsp; During his
short reign of seven years, there was the greatest political
agitation ever known in this country about a Reform of
Parliament, a measure which the people had long and earnestly
desired.&nbsp; Many meetings were held in this city, and
petitions were adopted in favour of reform, long called for and
long deferred.&nbsp; In fact, the king, during the early part of
his reign, had other and more pressing causes of anxiety.&nbsp;
His accession to the throne brought him an inheritance of the
jealousy, to which the country had been gradually roused, on the
subject of the extravagance and corruption of the old systems of
government.&nbsp; In the effort to reduce a vast expenditure, the
House of Commons was in no mood to be so liberal to the new
sovereign as he thought he had a right to expect.&nbsp; The
ministry were withheld, by the very forcible opposition of one of
its members, from asking the house to grant the expenses of the
queen&rsquo;s outfit, and the king himself had to submit to the
mortification of <a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
380</span>finding the pensions charged on the public by former
monarchs sharply criticised, and even his own household expenses
commented on with severity.</p>
<p>On September 8th, 1831, the grand ceremony of the coronation
of the king took place in Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; The auspicious
event was celebrated in Norwich in a most loyal and joyous
manner.&nbsp; The festivities of the day commenced with the merry
chime of St. Peter&rsquo;s bells, and the waving of banners from
all the public buildings.&nbsp; The mayor and members of the
corporation went in procession from the Guildhall to the
Cathedral.&nbsp; After their return to the hall, the regiment of
the First Royals marched into the Market Place and fired three
vollies.&nbsp; The electors who had supported Gurney and Grant
received &pound;1 each, and a dinner was given to 600 of the
freemen, who voted for Wetherell and Sadler, at Laccohee&rsquo;s
gardens.&nbsp; The citizens, in fact, have never lost an
opportunity of displaying their loyalty, but they always expected
something in return.&nbsp; Several petitions were sent from
Norwich in favour of the Reform Bill; and the passing of the bill
was celebrated here with great rejoicings, festivities, and a
public procession on July 5th, 1832.&nbsp; This brief reign was
remarkable, moreover, for the abolition of the slave trade after
a violent agitation which convulsed the whole country, and ended
in the passing of an act of emancipation of the slaves in the
West Indies, at a cost of twenty millions; and it is also noted
for the suppression of the rebellion in Canada, and the
restoration of tranquillity to that colony.</p>
<p><a name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>An
Act of Parliament received the royal assent on June 23rd, 1832,
removing the assizes from Thetford to Norwich; and the
corporation passed a vote of thanks to John Stracey, Esq., for
his exertions in obtaining that measure, and also a vote of
thanks to the lord chancellor for having granted two jail
deliveries in the year.&nbsp; Since then the city assizes have
been held at the Guildhall, and the Norfolk assizes at the
Shirehall.&nbsp; The city sessions are held every quarter at the
Guildhall, and the petty sessions daily at the same place.</p>
<p>The reformed House of Commons having presented an address to
His Majesty, praying for the appointment of a commission to
inquire as to the existing state of municipal corporations in
England and Wales; the king, on July 18th, 1833, complied with
the address, by issuing a commission; and notice was subsequently
given to the mayor of this city, S. Bignold, Esq. (now Sir Samuel
Bignold), of the intention of the commissioners appointed to
investigate the affairs of the Norwich corporation, in compliance
with a request from a meeting of 300 citizens, held on the 13th
of May preceding.&nbsp; A special meeting of the corporation was
at once convened to consider the course to be pursued, and the
assembly determined on a reluctant submission to the inquiry, so
far as regarded the production, by the corporate officers, of all
&ldquo;charters, books, deeds, accounts, papers, and muniments of
title,&rdquo; but at the same time protested against the
commission as illegal and unconstitutional, and against the right
of the commissioners to make any inquiry whatsoever.&nbsp; As may
be supposed, the <a name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
382</span>dominant party in the city did not like it, and the
sheriffs especially protested against it.&nbsp; They declined to
attend at the proposed enquiry, or to recognize the authority of
the commissioners by any act, and addressed a letter to that
effect to the commissioners, signing their names, W. J. <span
class="smcap">Utten Browne</span>, and <span class="smcap">Edward
Steward</span>, sheriffs of Norwich.&nbsp; Of course the
commissioners were not very pleased at this ostentatious
opposition to their authority, and in the course of their enquiry
showed an evident hostility to the predominant party.&nbsp;
Witnesses were allowed to make statements reflecting on the
characters of the living and the dead, and every facility was
afforded for the gratification of political, perhaps of
<i>private</i>, revenge.&nbsp; This will appear in the following
summary of the evidence, taken from the Digest, published soon
afterwards.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Inquiry Respecting the Old
Corporation</span>.</h4>
<p>This inquiry was conducted by George Long and John Buckle,
Esqs., and commenced on November 25th, 1833, at the
Guildhall.&nbsp; Nearly all the officials of the corporation were
examined, and many influential gentlemen.&nbsp; Some strange
statements were made as to the effects of party spirit, and the
enemies of the old corporation alleged, amongst their favourite
charges, that the magistrates were biassed by party spirit, and
that the funds of the corporation had been devoted to
electioneering purposes.&nbsp; Evidence, however, was given to
the contrary.</p>
<p><a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 383</span>J. J.
<span class="smcap">Gurney</span>, <span
class="smcap">Esq</span>., said, &ldquo;I believe that there are
many most laborious and useful magistrates in the city, and no
persons would be so fit as many of those who have already been
accustomed to the business.&nbsp; I do not find the slightest
fault with the application of the magisterial power.&nbsp; It is
my most decided opinion that the magisterial authority has been
impartially exercised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>W. <span class="smcap">Simpson</span>, <span
class="smcap">Esq</span>., said, &ldquo;Whatever money may have
been spent, it certainly has not been the money of the
corporation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alderman Bolingbroke</span> said, &ldquo;I
have been an alderman near twenty years; I do not know of any
corrupt application of the corporate funds to elections or any
other purposes.&nbsp; I do not think any misapplication of the
corporate funds could have taken place without my knowing
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the inquiry proceeded, however, evidence was given of the
influence of party spirit in the distribution of patronage,
appointments, and employments, and also in admissions to
freedom.&nbsp; It was proved that the police were very
inefficient, and often refused to act in cases of riot, and when
the mob were pulling down polling booths.&nbsp; As to the
expenditure of money at local elections,</p>
<p>The Mayor, S. <span class="smcap">Bignold</span>, Esq., said,
&ldquo;I am quite sure that if respectable persons were to offer
themselves at local elections, it would repress the excesses
which sometimes take place.&nbsp; The local elections are
attended with considerable expense.&nbsp; I am not aware that the
aldermen interfere in these elections.&nbsp; I am not aware of
anything which would prevent the aldermen interfering in the
promotion of sheriffs.&nbsp; They consider the oath as debarring
in the one case and not <a name="page384"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 384</span>in the other.&nbsp; Committees are
formed on the occasion of elections in the different wards.&nbsp;
I cannot say whether the aldermen are frequently members of those
committees.&nbsp; I have not had any opportunity of witnessing
unfair exertions.&nbsp; I cannot say whether any subscriptions
are made on those occasions.&nbsp; I have never subscribed a
shilling.&nbsp; I cannot say whether notes are given by the
aldermen or others.&nbsp; I never saw such a note as the one
produced before.&nbsp; I have heard of notes purporting to get
certain persons into the hospitals, being given by aldermen on
the occasions of municipal elections.&nbsp; I have never seen any
such notes.&nbsp; My knowledge of them has arisen in this
way.&nbsp; I have been asked myself and told that A and B have
given them, but never fulfilled their promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Question.&nbsp; Do you think that the mode in which the
local elections are carried on tends to keep out respectable and
intelligent persons from filling the various offices?</p>
<p>Answer.&nbsp; I am sorry to say that those respectable and
intelligent persons have contributed to the system.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Has that been the case generally?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; I should say, generally, with the leading persons in
this city on both sides, connected and unconnected with the
corporation.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Have the members of the court of aldermen contributed
to your knowledge?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Not to my knowledge.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Is it your belief that they have or have not?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; I think they would not in the election of an
alderman, but they might for sheriff or common councilmen.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; On what ground is that distinction made?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; The aldermen consider that they are not to interfere
in the election of their brethren, in consequence of the oath
they have taken.</p>
<p><a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
385</span>Q.&nbsp; The oath makes no distinction?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; There is an impression to the contrary.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; If there had been an extraordinary excitement at
elections, can you say that in no case that excitement was
enlarged by the aldermen?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; I should say in no case.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; What do you consider the intention of the aldermen in
subscribing to the funds?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; I can only answer that question in general terms,
that the excitement has never been increased by any act of the
aldermen.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Are you acquainted with the case of Hornigolds with
reference to the elections?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; In no other way than by your drawing my attention to
it.&nbsp; I know of no other note to that effect.&nbsp; No
improper persons have been admitted into the hospitals on account
of their votes.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Have they in all cases been fit and proper
persons?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Certainly they have.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Do you think the same persons would have been
introduced if they had not been political supporters?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Not identically the same persons.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Are there instances where persons have been put in by
the aldermen, who have not been political supporters?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I have put an individual in myself who was
not a political supporter in any way.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Are such instances rare or frequent?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; I am only able to answer from information I have
derived from my seniors; I should say they are frequent.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Are the great majority of persons admitted
freemen?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I think they are.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Are the exceptions few?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; I do not know.</p>
<p><a name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
386</span>Q.&nbsp; You said all the freemen introduced to the
hospitals were fit and proper persons: have they been introduced
as the political friends of the aldermen?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I should certainly introduce my political
friends in preference.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Do you consider the power of the aldermen to have
been exercised <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>, or for influence at the
elections?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Certainly, <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Do you think this privilege is frequently exercised
in favor of political opponents?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; There are twenty-four aldermen, and the
patronage is about 15&ndash;24ths on the Tory side to
9&ndash;24ths on the Whig side.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Is it your opinion that more urgent cases have been
passed by, and others taken on account of political services?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; I think not; I think very pressing cases have had the
preference over political supporters.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; Is it, in your opinion, a justification if a person
is put into the hospital under such a promise, or a more pressing
case; and would the alderman exercising the power, do it under an
impression that he was not guilty of any breach of duty, or of
violating his moral feelings?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; I think where an alderman had made such a promise, he
would be perfectly justified in performing it, provided the
person was a fit and proper object.</p>
<p>Q.&nbsp; The alderman, so promising, in the event of a more
pressing case, would he change his turn?</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; It is done frequently for the express purpose in
pressing cases; and those changes are made with political
opponents.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alderman Newton</span> examined, said,
&ldquo;I have no doubt there have been large sums of money
expended at local elections.&nbsp; It has been a common thing to
make subscriptions <a name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
387</span>for local elections.&nbsp; Sometimes the subscriptions
have far exceeded the necessary expenses.&nbsp; In some cases,
but not generally, the subscriptions have been under the
management of a committee.&nbsp; An individual mostly takes the
management.&nbsp; He has the whole of the funds under his care,
and is not accountable to anyone.&nbsp; The committee never
interfere.&nbsp; It is left to one individual to manage the
funds.&nbsp; The mode of distributing the money is known to
members of the committees, who are generally members of the
corporation.&nbsp; I do not know of aldermen being members of the
committees.&nbsp; Aldermen have subscribed, but very rarely, at
contested elections.&nbsp; A good deal of money has been expended
on those occasions.&nbsp; The general supporters of the parties
have been subscribers, including the common council, but not the
aldermen.&nbsp; The scenes at elections have been very
disgraceful sometimes.&nbsp; I recollect the election of Alderman
Marshall.&nbsp; I have heard that the scene on that occasion was
very disgraceful.&nbsp; I have heard that much money was spent,
but I think &pound;1000 would be the outside.&nbsp; I recollect
the election of Alderman Steward.&nbsp; Money was spent on that
occasion, but nothing like &pound;1000.&nbsp; I remember the
election of Mr. Steward for sheriff.&nbsp; I have heard that
money was then spent.&nbsp; I heard that the Whig party gave a
large sum for the last six votes that they polled, and I believe
it to a certain extent.&nbsp; No doubt there was money spent by
the Tory party to a large extent.&nbsp; I have heard that from
&pound;10 to &pound;15 were given for a vote.&nbsp; There was a
large subscription by members of the council, but not by the
aldermen.&nbsp; I think Mr. Steward subscribed, but I do not know
to what amount.&nbsp; On other occasions subscriptions have been
made for the same office.&nbsp; Money was given to the freemen,
but the far greater amount was spent in giving them beer and
tobacco on either side.&nbsp; It has been carried <a
name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 388</span>to a
greater extent by the Gurneys than by any other persons.&nbsp; I
have no doubt that the money was given for bribery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>J. J. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>, Esq.; stated that the
assertion as to bribery by the Gurneys was utterly false as to
him; that he had never given a farthing for the purpose of
bribery; nor had the firm done so; nor had they any loans; nor
had their clerks been employed for such a purpose; had the
deepest impression of the sin, guilt, and misery, involved in our
local elections; and he would rather have his arm cut off than
promote them directly, or in any way whatsoever.&nbsp; Not only
had there been bribery, but a system of demoralization to a
fearful extent; but treating was the root of the mischief
here.&nbsp; He believed the root of the evil was the election of
the magistrates and corporate officers by popular means.</p>
<p>The commissioners asked, What mode of election do you consider
would be preferable? and Mr. J. J. Gurney replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think that the magistrates, being the
representatives of the king, ought to be appointed by the
executive government; I mean those officers connected with the
government of the town.&nbsp; The parties here are evenly
balanced, and it therefore becomes a close contest.&nbsp; Nothing
gives us rest but the predominance of one party.&nbsp; We are at
rest now solely owing to the predominance of the Tory
party.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good deal of evidence was given of the great extent to which
the system of cooping was carried on at elections.&nbsp; Voters
had been frequently taken away by force a dozen miles, locked up
in public houses and half-starved in them, and otherwise
ill-treated.&nbsp; This system was carried on by both
parties.&nbsp; The worst <a name="page389"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 389</span>proceedings of this sort seem to
have occurred at the elections of Alderman Angell and Alderman
Springfield, when there was a vast amount of bribery, treating,
and cooping.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">William Wilde</span>, afterwards
coroner, gave evidence as to the election of Alderman
Springfield, in November, 1821.&nbsp; He was one of the committee
for conducting that election.&nbsp; Mr. Ives, a retired clergyman
of the Church of England, was the other candidate.&nbsp; The
Northern ward was then two to one in favour of Springfield.&nbsp;
About 440 to 240 would have been a fair poll if no money had been
given.&nbsp; When the vacancy occurred, Mr. Springfield was not
in Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. Wilde continued, &ldquo;I sent for him
express, and when he returned we heard from good authority that
great sums had been offered by Ives&rsquo;s party first.&nbsp; We
generally sent out freemen to see how markets were going.&nbsp;
Springfield was returned, though it was generally reported that
Ives&rsquo;s party meant to buy the ward.&nbsp; But Springfield
said he would not be bought out.&nbsp; We went then into a
regular system of buying, they buying all the men of ours they
could, and we buying all of theirs we could.&nbsp; About
&pound;10 was a regular price.&nbsp; We spent &pound;600 or
&pound;700 in buying votes.&nbsp; On the morning of the election,
Mr. Ives&rsquo;s party commenced by giving two sovereigns each at
the polling place.&nbsp; Mr. Springfield paid his men the
same.&nbsp; In consequence more than 300 out of 430 who voted for
Springfield took two sovereigns at the booths.&nbsp; Persons draw
a distinction between money paid at the booths, and a bribe at
any other place.&nbsp; Many who take money at the booths will not
accept bribes in any other shape.&nbsp; Springfield&rsquo;s
election cost &pound;1530.&nbsp; The money at the booths is
openly given, and it is not considered a crime to take it.&nbsp;
I think about 60 or <a name="page390"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 390</span>70 persons sold their votes at
&pound;10 apiece.&nbsp; Small shopkeepers are not a bit better
than freemen.&nbsp; I have stood openly in the market to buy
votes with money in my hand.&nbsp; This system is generally acted
upon at all contested elections where the money can be
found.&nbsp; Nothing but poverty of purse makes purity of
election in Norwich.&nbsp; At Alderman Angell&rsquo;s election
the same system was followed.&nbsp; It is the same at ward
elections.&nbsp; I have given &pound;30 for a vote at an election
for common council only for a year, but there are few instances
of such a high price.&nbsp; I once gave the father of a nominee
&pound;20 for his vote.&nbsp; That sum is frequently given.&nbsp;
I have known promissory notes given for votes.&nbsp; I do not
recollect an instance of notes given by aldermen, but 1 have no
doubt of the fact.&nbsp; The usual plan is for a person to say
&lsquo;My family wall not vote unless you give a turn at the
hospital,&rsquo; and application is then made to an
alderman.&nbsp; I think the effects of what I have been stating
are most debasing and demoralising.&nbsp; I have known poor men
who have for years withstood the temptations offered them at
elections; and when once they have fallen into the snare, I have
observed their conduct to alter, and they have been much
changed.&nbsp; I am perfectly satisfied of the evil tendency of
the course pursued hitherto, and in very few instances has the
money given been any benefit to the freemen, but quite the
contrary.&nbsp; The effect has been the same with both the giver
and receiver of bribes.&nbsp; I should be sorry to bring up any
of my children in the course which I have pursued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Buckle then thanked Mr. Wilde for the very open
and candid manner in which he had given his evidence.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">John Rising Staff</span> said that on
Alderman Angell&rsquo;s election, for two days and two nights
previous the town was in a state of great disorder, occasioned by
large <a name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
391</span>parties of men employed by each party going about the
streets molesting any persons whom they met of the opposite
party, attacking freemen personally, and by improper intrusions
into their dwelling houses or other places where they were
supposed to be concealed.&nbsp; In some instances where they were
in search for a voter, and could not find him at his own
residence, they went into the residence of other persons, not in
the ward where the election was to take place, to search for
individuals.&nbsp; Witness gave several instances of cooping.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alderman Bolingbroke</span> also stated
instances of cooping that came under his notice as a
magistrate.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. John Francis</span> said, &ldquo;I
have been a manufacturer in Norwich many years, and I consider
the acts of the corporation to have engendered every species of
bribery and strife.&nbsp; Its patronage is invariably exercised
in favour of political adherents.&nbsp; During the last ten years
our commercial interests have materially suffered from it.&nbsp;
It creates disunion between those gentlemen where friendship
would otherwise exist.&nbsp; The local elections are pregnant
with evil; they take men from their work, those who are not free
as well as those who are free; and in case of a contest it is
impossible to get any work done for six weeks after; and this in
the spring time of the year when work is brisk and calls for
close attendance.&nbsp; The consequence is that the masters
suffer materially.&nbsp; I never engaged in bribery at elections,
except at the late election for sheriff, when I bought a bunch of
four in the market for &pound;8; I also offered another man
&pound;5, but he wanted &pound;10, which I thought too
much.&nbsp; The numbers, however, were running close, and I went
to buy him at that price, but I found that he had been settled
for and voted.&nbsp; Therefore I saved &pound;10.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. A. <span class="smcap">Barnard</span> said, &ldquo;At the
election of Mr. Foster as <a name="page392"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 392</span>sheriff, I bought about forty votes
at from 30s. to &pound;4 apiece.&nbsp; I know personally of no
instances of bribery by an alderman.&nbsp; I have known instances
of an alderman saying, &lsquo;You may make use of my turn in the
hospital to get a vote.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have known this five or
six times.&nbsp; These promises were given by three
aldermen.&nbsp; I decline to give their names.&nbsp; I have no
objection to say they were Whigs.&nbsp; I have acted frequently
as paymaster at elections.&nbsp; Aldermen have often subscribed
for ward elections.&nbsp; Both parties are pretty much
alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George Palmer</span> was examined very
closely, and he stated that he had always voted in the Whig
interest, and that he had received a note from Alderman
Springfield for four shillings weekly till his brother&rsquo;s
child could be got into the hospital.&nbsp; The note was written
and signed by a Mr. Batson in Mr. Springfield&rsquo;s presence,
and by his order.&nbsp; It was given to witness for his vote in
favour of Mr. Foster at the election of sheriff in 1832.&nbsp;
Witness had never been offered the hospital by any alderman on
the other side.</p>
<p>A great deal more evidence was adduced as to notes of
admission to the hospital given by both parties.&nbsp; The last
part of the inquiry was the most important, relating as it did to
the effect of local elections on the trade of the city.</p>
<p>J. J. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>, <span
class="smcap">Esq</span>., said, &ldquo;I can assure the
commissioners that they have no notion of the sin, guilt,
wickedness, and poverty, which our local elections inflict upon
this city.&nbsp; I wish to add an expression of my conviction,
that if the election of magistrates and other officers was
altered, the whole city would be benefitted, and no persons more
so than the poor freemen.&nbsp; I was lately informed by a
principal manufacturer, who has large dealings with the poor,
that it <a name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
393</span>was his firm conviction that one single ward election
does more harm than all the preaching in all the churches and all
the meeting houses in all the year does good; and I believe it to
be true.&nbsp; I would observe that I make no distinction of
parties; both, to my knowledge, are equally guilty; and whenever
the managers find a purse, they fly to it as an eagle does to a
carcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. H. Willett</span> was of opinion that
the local elections were an injury to the lower orders,
notwithstanding the money they received.&nbsp; There was less
work done on account of these elections.&nbsp; Party had a very
injurious effect on the trade of the city.&nbsp; He thought
Norwich suffered from carrying on trade in a different manner to
that pursued in other towns.&nbsp; The trade had not paid in
previous years, and capital was not employed because it did not
pay.&nbsp; The trade was carried on upon such a system that there
was no inducement to employ capital.&nbsp; An open rate of wages
would cause capital to be more beneficially employed.&nbsp; A
great deal of capital had been lost to the city.&nbsp; At that
time there was less capital employed in this city than in any
manufacturing town of its size in the kingdom.&nbsp; He thought
the city had been brought into this state by a fixed rate of
wages, and the trade had been gradually leaving the city for
years.&nbsp; The fixed rate operated against the workmen, because
it prevented their being employed regularly.&nbsp; In consequence
of this small capitals were employed.&nbsp; The men thought they
would be injured by a fluctuating scale, but he believed the
contrary.&nbsp; While the country generally was never more
flourishing, the city was never in a worse state.&nbsp;
Manufacturers feared so much annoyance, that they would not risk
altering the present system.&nbsp; Many influential men were of
his opinion as to the fixed rate of wages, but dared not avow it,
lest they should lose their <a name="page394"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 394</span>political influence.&nbsp; He dared
not adopt the varied rate.&nbsp; He did not choose to subject
himself to the consequences.&nbsp; The weavers were the only
operatives who had a fixed rate.&nbsp; He believed that a fixed
rate was kept up by municipal elections, because the leading men
were afraid of losing their influence.&nbsp; Most of the
influential men were unconnected with manufactures.&nbsp; He
believed politics to be the first consideration with all of
them.&nbsp; He believed that the apprehension of violence
deterred all the manufacturers from attempting to alter the fixed
rate of wages; but wages were reduced, or else the whole trade
would have left the city.&nbsp; This caused such a disturbance
that he dared not go home.&nbsp; The civil power was not
sufficiently strong at the time, and the Dragoons were called out
to enable him to go home.&nbsp; His warehouse was attacked, and
his windows were broken.&nbsp; The magistrates rendered all the
assistance in their power, and measures were adopted to prevent
any further injury.&nbsp; His premises were guarded by special
constables for two or three weeks.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wright</span>, one of the largest
manufacturers of the city, said he was attacked in consequence of
his reducing wages.&nbsp; Vitriol was thrown on his face, by
which he lost the sight of one of his eyes.&nbsp; A majority of
the manufacturers considered a reduction of wages to be
necessary, but some of them became alarmed and did not
acknowledge it.&nbsp; The reduction prevented a further decrease
of a declining trade.&nbsp; But for the reduction there would
have been a greater decline of the trade.&nbsp; Formerly the
trade was very flourishing when there was a fixed rate of wages,
but that was when there was a great demand for Norwich crapes,
then very much worn for mourning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. John Francis</span>, a manufacturer,
said he did not quite agree with Mr. Willett.&nbsp; He did not
think a fixed <a name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
395</span>scale of wages advisable; but they were not in a
condition to alter it.&nbsp; He thought the alteration would
create more strife between masters and men.&nbsp; He considered a
fixed scale to be a disadvantage to the men, but it was not too
high.&nbsp; He believed that the local elections prevented
capital being employed, and disunited the people.&nbsp; But for
these local elections there would have been more trade.&nbsp;
Both parties had united in promoting one establishment, but six
such mills would not supply all the yarns wanted for Norwich
manufactures.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. John Athow</span> regarded the local
elections as the cause of the ruin of the city, as far as such
ruin had taken place; as ruinous both to property and
morals.&nbsp; The mode in which the elections were then conducted
had contributed to the poverty and depravity of the city.&nbsp;
He believed that the streets were in a more disgraceful state
than in any other town, from what he had seen, and from what he
had heard from commercial men visiting Norwich.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R. M. Bacon</span>, then editor of the
<i>Norwich Mercury</i>, believed that the prosperity of the city
and private intercourse were all poisoned by the party spirit
engendered by frequent municipal elections.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. J. W. Robberds</span>, a manufacturer,
connected with the corporation from 1807 till 1827, said that
during that period he had seen the working of the municipal
system, and witnessed the strife of parties.&nbsp; He believed
that by the contests in the different wards the character of the
whole population of the city had been greatly deteriorated; that
a great depravity among the lower classes had been produced; and
that the character of the whole corporation had been
affected.&nbsp; He knew that individuals had entered the
corporation, not from any consideration of public duty, but to
serve their own private interests.</p>
<h4><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
396</span><span class="smcap">The Election of Stormont and
Scarlett</span>.</h4>
<p>During the inquiry of the commissioners, evidence was taken as
to the general election of the previous year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Rust</span> stated, &ldquo;Mr.
Grimmer, in order to induce me to vote for Stormont and Scarlett,
offered to pay me &pound;50 down, and to procure me &pound;50 of
the city money after Christmas.&nbsp; He promised distinctly to
procure the city money.&nbsp; I have taken an active part at
general elections.&nbsp; I believe there was great bribery at the
last election for members of parliament.&nbsp; I do not think
there was any bribery previous to the last election.&nbsp; I do
not know any instance of it.&nbsp; I saw some bribery at the last
general election.&nbsp; I was up two nights working for the
party.&nbsp; I never had money offered to me at local elections,
but I was offered &pound;100 at the last general election to go
out and buy votes.&nbsp; The proposition was made by two leading
partizans of Stormont and Scarlett.&nbsp; One of the parties
produced a large quantity of promissory notes.&nbsp; I told him
that he was playing a dangerous game.&nbsp; The partizan said
&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t I lend money to whom I like?&rsquo;&nbsp; I
replied, &lsquo;I think not; it depends on the
conditions.&rsquo;&nbsp; The gentleman who made the proposition
said, &ldquo;This is the way we do business.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
proposers were not members of the corporation.&nbsp; They went
away and called again.&nbsp; One of them pulled out a large bag
of sovereigns, and said he would not only lend me &pound;100, but
give it to me to join the party, and to do what I could in the
Northern ward.&nbsp; They declared more than once that they were
determined to buy it.&nbsp; They were guardians of the
poor.&nbsp; There was no distinction as to the voters to be
bought; freemen as well as others.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 397</span><span
class="smcap">Henry Bush</span> said, &ldquo;Alderman Turner
authorized me to give &pound;6 to a voter, to vote for Lord
Stormont and Sir James Scarlett, and said that was the most money
they were then giving.&nbsp; I would not take the money as I said
it was not enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alderman Turner</span> declared on
oath that the statement was false.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. John Hayes</span> said, &ldquo;On the
second day of the last general election, Mr. George Liddell gave
me three sovereigns for my vote, but never told me in which
interest I was to vote.&nbsp; Mr. Wortley, one of the common
council, also gave me three sovereigns to vote in the interest of
Stormont and Scarlett.&nbsp; I took the sovereigns but voted in
the Whig interest, and carried the money to the committee and
gave it to Mr. Beare and Mr. Springfield.&nbsp; It was returned
to me in four months afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wortley</span> denied the statement,
but several persons were named who were present when Mr. Wortley
paid the money.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cozens</span> was examined as to the
evidence which had been given before the House of Commons&rsquo;
committee by Mr. W. J. U. Browne, then sheriff, who when asked
whether there was any committee for conducting the election of
Lord Stormont and Sir James Scarlett, replied, &ldquo;Certainly
not;&rdquo; and the manuscript was produced of a letter which
appeared in the <i>Mercury</i>, in answer to one sent out by Mr.
Robberds, in which Mr. Browne spoke of &ldquo;the committee for
conducting the election,&rdquo; and signed himself as
chairman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. J. Francis</span> mentioned
circumstances to prove that there was a committee, and produced a
note.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. William Cooper</span>, deposed,
&ldquo;There was no formal committee.&nbsp; If anybody had asked
him for a committee man, he could not have stated one.&nbsp; He
should say the <a name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
398</span>whole party formed the committee.&nbsp; He was active
during the election, but he was not aware that he belonged to any
committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Commissioner
Buckle</span>:&mdash;&ldquo;We have a letter in Mr.
Browne&rsquo;s own handwriting, in which he states that the
committee was not dissolved, and he signs himself
chairman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cooper</span> observed, &ldquo;Mr.
Browne has given his own explanation of that.&nbsp; I am not
prepared to give any other interpretation to the
circumstance.&nbsp; I have given my opinion and my belief as to
the existence of the committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Commissioner Long</span> said, &ldquo;I
have no doubt, Mr. Cooper, you have spoken perfectly
correct.&nbsp; At some elections there are committees, and at
others it is thought better to avoid them.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After the prolonged inquiry, a special meeting of the
corporate body was held on January 9th, 1834, to determine what
should be done in consequence of the course pursued by the
commissioners.&nbsp; A great deal of virtuous indignation was
expressed, and it was resolved&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That it is the confirmed opinion of this
assembly, that this corporation would have been perfectly
justified in refusing their sanction to the attendance of their
members and officers, and in declining to allow the production of
their charters and muniments before the commissioners,
considering themselves well advised in regarding the commission
as an assumption of power contrary to law, and as an exercise of
prerogative, totally at variance with those constitutional
principles which, in defining the limits of regal authority,
guarantee alike the public rights and the private of the
subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
399</span>&ldquo;That on these grounds, and influenced solely by
a strong sense of duty, the assembly of the 15th November last,
recorded their protest against a commission so dangerous in
precedent, so menacing to the privileges of chartered
institutions, and so hostile to the cause of civil liberty.&nbsp;
Yet, at the same time, animated with reverential attachment to
the king, unwilling to be deficient in proper respect towards
functionaries acting in the sovereign&rsquo;s name, and above all
being unconscious of having, either in a corporate or magisterial
capacity, done any act calculated to prejudice the interests of
the city, or to bring discredit on themselves as a body, the
assembly of the 15th November last, ordered that the town clerk
and other officers should give the fullest documentary
information for which the commissioners might think fit to
call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That this corporation not only by such order, but also
by subsequently permitting oral evidence to be given by their
members and officers, now feel themselves the more imperatively
called upon to express their mingled sentiments of regret and
disapproval at the course of examination pursued, an examination
governed by no rules of evidence recognised in any English courts
of law, but carried on in a manner irregular, vague, and
arbitrary, precluding the slightest hope of arrival at such a
conclusion as can possibly conduce to the ends of truth and
justice, still less such as can prove congenial to the good
feelings of any well-regulated, candid, and impartial
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That this assembly, considering that the great mass of
information received by the commissioners, emanated from the most
decided and unscrupulous partizans; that many of them were
intimately connected with, and implicated in the transactions to
which allusions were made; that those allusions involved charges
against highly respected and <a name="page400"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 400</span>honourable individuals, since
deceased, whose representatives had no means of refuting the
aspersions cast upon their memories; that many also of those who
came forward as the most material witnesses to impugn the conduct
and character of the corporate body, stand self-convicted as the
active unblushing agents of gross corruption, and by their own
admissions have proved themselves unworthy of
credit&mdash;considering all these things, and looking moreover
to the incontrovertible fact, that not one farthing of the
corporate funds has been either appropriated to electioneering
purposes or diverted from its originally destined and legitimate,
object&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do <span class="GutSmall">PROTEST</span> against any
report being made by the municipal commissioners respecting the
corporation of Norwich, based on statements so utterly unfit to
justify parliament in legislating on so important a subject, and
do most respectfully towards the crown, but with firmness and
fidelity to the obligation of their oaths as corporators, deem it
their duty to resist every attempt to exact from them a surrender

throughout the kingdom to make common cause with them in
endeavouring by every lawful and constitutional means of
resistance to defeat any design that may be in contemplation for
wresting from them their ancient charters, franchises, and

</blockquote>
<p>A committee was appointed for this purpose, and to devise
means for protecting the charters, rights, and privileges of the
corporation.&nbsp; But all this opposition proved to be of no
avail, and the Municipal Reform Act came into operation in
1835.</p>

registered voters was 4018.&nbsp; At the election in this month,
the bribery oath was administered to every voter.&nbsp; Sir James
Scarlett, who had represented the city in parliament from 1832 to
1834, on being made Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer, was
raised to the peerage by the title of Baron Abinger of Abinger,
in the county of Surrey, and of the city of Norwich.&nbsp; He
took for his motto, &ldquo;<i>Stat viribis suis</i>,&rdquo; and
on application to the corporation, was permitted to use the two
angels, supporters to the city arms, as supporters to his
own.</p>
<p>On January 28th, the first <i>conversazione</i> of the Norfolk
and Norwich Museum was held, and was well attended.&nbsp; On the
27th and 28th, a dinner was given to the electors who voted for
the defeated candidates, Messrs. Harbord and Martin, at the late
election.&nbsp; About 1000 dined on the first day.</p>
<p>March 23rd.&nbsp; A meeting of the hand-loom weavers was held
in the Cellar House, at St. Martin&rsquo;s at Oak, to petition
the legislature to establish local boards of trade.</p>
<p>In April an alteration was made in the conveyance of letters
to and from London, being transmitted by the Ipswich instead of
the Newmarket Mail, by which means the citizens got their letters
earlier.&nbsp; On the third of this month the mayor and
corporation waited on Lord Abinger, at the lodgings of the
judges, with an address of congratulation on his first visit to
the city in his judicial capacity.</p>
<p>June 16th.&nbsp; William Moore, Esq., was sworn into office as
mayor of the city.&nbsp; This was the last Guild <a
name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 402</span>day under
the old corporation.&nbsp; It was celebrated with all the
customary civic splendour.&nbsp; The Latin speech was delivered
at the porch of the Free School by Master Chambers, son of John
Chambers, Esq., of the Close, and he was presented with books to
the value of &pound;5 5s., as was also Master Norgate, the orator
of the preceding year.&nbsp; At the dinner in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall about 800 ladies and gentlemen sat down to a sumptuous
repast.</p>
<p>July 14th.&nbsp; A meeting of the freemen was held in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall to petition parliament to preserve to them
and their children the privileges they had so long enjoyed, but
they soon lost their exclusive privilege of voting for members of
the corporation.&nbsp; The Municipal Reform Bill passed on
September 8th, and received the royal assent on the following
day.&nbsp; On Sunday, September 27th, the mayor and corporation
attended divine service in the Cathedral for the last time under
the old charters.&nbsp; The Hon. and Very Rev. the Dean (Dr.
Pellew) preached the funeral sermon of the old corporation.</p>
<p>Michaelmas day this year passed over without the customary
ceremony, owing to the new Municipal Act coming into force.&nbsp;
From 1403 it had been customary to swear the sheriffs into office
on that day, and for many years they had given inauguration
dinners.&nbsp; Mr. Winter, the last speaker of the old
corporation, was presented with a handsome piece of plate by that
body on October 21st; and at a special assembly held on December
17th, a vote of thanks was passed to the mayor, William Moore,
Esq.&nbsp; This <a name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

first election of councillors took place under the new law.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1836</b>.&nbsp; January 1st.&nbsp; T. O. Springfield, Esq.,
was chosen the first mayor of the new corporation.&nbsp; He had
been a very active partizan in the Liberal interest.&nbsp; He was
a member of the council nearly all his long life; his influence
was very great in promoting the return of candidates of his own
party.&nbsp; On the occasion of his going out of office, a dinner
was given to him in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; About 600 sat
down to a sumptuous banquet.</p>
<p>March 1st.&nbsp; The new police, eighteen in number, made
their first appearance under Chief Constable Yarington.</p>
<p>On September 20th, 21st, and 22nd, the Norfolk and Norwich
Musical Festival was held in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, when the
concerts were well attended, and realised a large sum for the
charities.</p>
<p>December 1st.&nbsp; S. Bignold, Esq., was the chief promoter
of the Norwich Yarn Company, which had a large capital, the whole
of which was lost to the shareholders.&nbsp; On the occasion of
laying the first stone of the yarn factory, the pageant in honour
of &ldquo;Bishop Blaize&rdquo; was revived, on December 1st,
1836.&nbsp; The whole affair was cleverly got up, and admirably
conducted.&nbsp; The procession having completed a tour of the
city, returned to St. Edmund&rsquo;s, <a name="page404"></a><span

Reign of Queen Victoria.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen Victoria</span> was proclaimed here
in the usual manner, on June 23rd, 1837, amid great
rejoicing.&nbsp; On Thursday, August 17th, Dr. Stanley was
enthroned in the Cathedral; he was the sixty-sixth bishop of the
diocese, and the thirty-third since the reformation.&nbsp; After
the installation about a hundred of the gentry, clergy, and laity
dined at the Norfolk Hotel.&nbsp; This bishop was a great
promoter of the education of the poor.&nbsp; An episcopal chapel
was opened in Heigham on August 10th, and afterwards consecrated
by the bishop under the name of &ldquo;Trinity
Chapel.&rdquo;&nbsp; His lordship also consecrated the new church
at Catton.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1838</b>.&nbsp; January 3rd.&nbsp; A meeting was held in
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall to petition parliament to abolish the
apprenticeship of negroes in the colonies.&nbsp; On the 5th the
new district schools were opened in St. Augustine&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><a name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 406</span>On
July 11th, a very numerous meeting of the camlet weavers was
held, for the purpose of resisting the proposed reduction of
wages.&nbsp; About this time some differences existed between the
men and their employers respecting wages.&nbsp; Col. Harvey was
requested to mediate between them, and he did so, but without any
good result.&nbsp; The city was much disturbed in consequence of
these disagreements.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1839</b>.&nbsp; On May 18th, a meeting was held at the
Norfolk Hotel to consider a bill about to be presented to
parliament for the improvement of the city, and to give the
citizens an opportunity of objecting to any of its clauses.&nbsp;
On June 19th this bill passed, but very little was done under it
in the way of improvement.&nbsp; A great part of the city
remained undrained, and the pavements continued in a bad
state.</p>
<p>On August 16th, the Norfolk and Norwich Art Union opened their
exhibition of pictures at the Bazaar in St. Andrew&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
About 400 pictures were exhibited, some of them of great
merit.</p>
<p>About this time much excitement prevailed in the city
respecting the designs of the Chartists, who, although they were
not numerous, were considered dangerous, as they were known to
possess arms, many guns and pikes having been taken from them by
the police.&nbsp; On Sunday, August 18th, the Chartists attended
divine service at the Cathedral, when the bishop made a spirited
appeal to them.&nbsp; Many meetings of the Chartists were held,
and exciting harangues were delivered, advocating the five points
of the <a name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
407</span>charter, including universal suffrage, and vote by
ballot, which, some of their opponents said, meant
&ldquo;Universal suffering, and vote by bullet.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1840</b>.&nbsp; On February 10th, Queen Victoria&rsquo;s
wedding day was kept as a holiday, and addresses were adopted, to
be presented to Her Majesty and Prince Albert.&nbsp; The poor of
the various parishes were substantially regaled, and the citizens
were admitted free to the pit and gallery of the theatre.&nbsp;
On many subsequent occasions, on the birth of a prince or
princess, the citizens have shown their loyalty by presenting
addresses of congratulation.</p>
<p>On February 25th, a meeting was held in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall to consider the necessity of a bill then before parliament,
for &ldquo;repealing and altering the existing paving
acts,&rdquo; and to oppose the same, if necessary: when a
petition was adopted to be presented to the House of Commons,
praying that the bill might not pass.&nbsp; The Marquis of Douro
presented the petition.</p>
<p>On June 15th, at a meeting in the Guildhall, addresses of
congratulation were agreed on, to be presented to the Queen and
Prince Albert, on their happy escape from an attempt at
assassination.</p>
<p>The first annual meeting of the Norfolk and Norwich Protestant
Association was held on October 15th in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall,
when 2000 persons were present.&nbsp; Addresses were delivered
advocating the Protestant cause.&nbsp; Subsequently many similar
meetings were held in this city.&nbsp; The speakers always raised
the cry <a name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
408</span>of &ldquo;no popery,&rdquo; explaining that they meant,
&ldquo;No withholding of the bible from the people; no
worshipping of God in a dead language; no bowing down before
images as helps to devotion; no divine homage offered to a human
being, though the mother of our Lord; no prayers to saints; no
priests pretending to offer the sacrifice of Christ continually
in the mass; no polluting confessional; no persecuting
inquisition; no Jesuits with their hidden works of darkness; no
licenses for doing evil that good may come; no absolution for the
worst of crimes; no power of a priesthood over courts of law; no
canon law to overrule the statutes of the realm; no cursing with
bell, book, and candle; no enforced celibacy; no nunneries where
women are buried alive; no convents for lazy, vicious monks; no
masses for the dead; no fictitious purgatory; no power of priests
to forgive sins,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1841</b>.&nbsp; In June this year the census of the united
kingdom was taken, and the result, as regarded this city, showed
but a small increase of the population, the total number being
62,294, while in 1831 the number was 61,304.&nbsp; The number of
hand-loom weavers had been greatly diminished by the competition
of steam power.&nbsp; Many of them left the city, and others went
into the boot and shoe trade, which had now become of some
importance.</p>
<p>This year many political meetings were held in the city, of
Tories, Whigs, Radicals, and Chartists.&nbsp; The prospect of a
general election kept the city in a state of great
excitement.&nbsp; The leaders of the two former <a
name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 409</span>parties
tried to prevent a repetition of such scenes as had taken place,
by a compromise, which was a most hateful thing to the freemen,
and working men generally.&nbsp; When the election came on in
June, Mr. Dover, a Chartist, nominated Mr. Eagle, a Chartist, of
Suffolk, and afterwards, it was said, received a bribe of
&pound;50 to withdraw the nomination.&nbsp; In consequence of
this, a riotous mob assembled in the Market Place, and Dover had
to be protected by the police from their violence, for if they
had got hold of him, they seemed as though they would have torn
him in pieces.&nbsp; On the following day the mob having learned
that Dover was at a public house in St. George&rsquo;s Colegate,
went there and dragged him thence, threatening to throw him into
the river.&nbsp; He was much injured, and would probably have
lost his life but for the timely arrival of the police.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1843</b>.&nbsp; On August 9th, a dreadful storm of hail,
rain, wind, and thunder, passed over the city and county, and did
immense damage to property, especially to the growing
crops.&nbsp; Parochial subscriptions were raised to the amount of
&pound;5,622, and private subscriptions &pound;4,391, towards
compensating the sufferers for their losses.&nbsp; An immense
number of windows were broken by the hail in the city, and many
places were flooded.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1844</b>.&nbsp; This year the railway was opened between
Yarmouth and Norwich, and in the next year the line was opened
from Norwich to Brandon, simultaneously <a
name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 410</span>with the
Eastern Counties line from London to Ely.&nbsp; This caused an
entire change in the mode of travelling, and in the carrying
trade of the district.&nbsp; All the old stage coaches were of
course discontinued.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Poor Law Reform</span>.</h4>
<p><b>1846</b>.&nbsp; About the year 1846, the high rates in
Norwich became the subject of complaint and discussion.&nbsp; A
good deal of alarm was excited in the city in consequence of a
proposal of Sir Robert Peel, then prime minister, to alter the
law of settlement, so that all persons who had resided five years
in any place should have a permanent settlement there.&nbsp; As
many families belonging to the county parishes were then resident
in Norwich, it was feared that they would become chargeable to
the city and be a permanent burden on the rate-payers.&nbsp; This
apprehension proved to be well founded, for after the passing of
the Poor Removal Act, hundreds of county families did become
chargeable to the city, and have been so ever since.</p>
<p>Mr. G. Gedge, of Catton, instituted inquiries on the subject;
and being a member of the court of guardians, often called
attention to it.&nbsp; He was, in fact, the first in this city to
advocate a general or national rate as the most effectual remedy
for the evils of the then existing system of rating.&nbsp; He
spared neither time, trouble, nor expense in promoting his views,
which were generally approved by the more influential
citizens.&nbsp; He employed Mr. Hutchinson, an eminent statist in
London, on the recommendation of Mr. <a name="page411"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 411</span>Wakley, to collect information
respecting the gross inequalities of the system of rating all
over England, and this information was published and circulated
in a valuable work, from which nearly all the statistics on the
subject have been derived and quoted by members of
Parliament.</p>
<p>Mr. Gedge introduced the question of a national rate at many
meetings of the court of guardians in 1846.&nbsp; He showed that
the poor rates then collected annually amounted to about five
millions.&nbsp; Nearly the same sum was raised by the property
and income tax; and it followed that if only those were rated who
paid the latter tax, the charge throughout England and Wales for
the support of the poor would not amount to more than sevenpence
in the pound.&nbsp; But including all the parties not then
chargeable to the property and income tax, and who would be
fairly liable to the poor rates, the annual rate would not amount
to more than half that sum.&nbsp; This would be a most important
difference to the great mass of the rate-payers, whose payments
to the relief of the poor would be greatly diminished, whilst
they would have the pleasure of knowing that the poor would be
better cared for, and that those comforts which they had a right
to expect, as producers of wealth, would be placed more
immediately within their reach.</p>
<p>Mr. Gedge explained that, as all the parishes in the city were
incorporated in regard to the relief of the poor, a general rate
being raised from all those parishes for that purpose, his
proposition was that this general mode of rating should be
extended over the <a name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
412</span>whole country, and that a general rate should be raised
to be applied for the relief of the poor wherever they were
located.&nbsp; He showed that if each parish in this city
supported its own poor, the rating would be very unequal, and
some of the richest parishes would pay least, while the poorest
and more populous would pay most.&nbsp; To prevent this
inequality, all the parishes had been incorporated.&nbsp; This
had been found to be a great improvement, and it should be
further extended.&nbsp; Many persons, fund-holders and others,
living in lodgings, were exempted from poor rates.&nbsp; Many
large establishments in Cheapside and the middle of London paid
no poor rates, because the poor did not live in those
localities.&nbsp; Many persons living in fashionable towns also
escaped poor rates, for the same reason, while the industrious
and the middle classes had to bear the burden.&nbsp; He therefore
maintained that there should be a national rate.</p>
<p>Most of the members of the court of guardians concurred with
these views, and ultimately a petition to Parliament was adopted
in favour of a national rate.&nbsp; The petition was duly
presented in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, June 10th, 1846, an important meeting of the
rate-payers of the city was held in the sessions court, at the
Guildhall, to petition Parliament against the Poor Law Removal
Act, which had been lately introduced into the House of
Commons.&nbsp; The mayor, J. Betts, Esq., presided and opened the
proceedings.&nbsp; Mr. S. Bignold, Mr. T. Brightwell, <a
name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 413</span>Mr. J. G.
Johnson, Mr. E. Willett, Mr. A. A. H. Beckwith, Mr. Banks, Mr.
Newbegin, Mr. Hardy, &amp; Mr. G. Gedge, addressed the meeting in
support of resolutions, and a petition was adopted against the
proposed alteration in the Law of Settlement and the Poor Law
Removal Bill.&nbsp; Mr. G. Gedge moved a resolution,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That this meeting is decidedly of opinion
that the only effectual alteration of the law of settlement, by
which free scope would be given to the labour of the people,
would be to abolish the present law of settlement and rating, and
to substitute a general national tax on real and personal
property, and that a petition founded on this resolution be
presented to the House of Commons.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He showed the very injurious operation of the law then
existing, and expressed his belief that a national rate, if
obtained, would prove a great benefit to the city.&nbsp; Mr.
Sheriff Colman seconded the resolution, which was carried
unanimously.</p>
<p>After this meeting, two petitions were presented to
Parliament, from this city, in favour of a national rate; one
from the court of guardians, and one from the citizens at
large.&nbsp; These petitions, however, had no effect, and the
Poor Law Removal Bill was passed into a law.&nbsp; The
consequence was, that about 1500 families belonging to county
parishes, who had lived five years in the city, obtained a
settlement in it, and most of them soon applied for relief.&nbsp;
This greatly increased the expenditure for the relief of the
poor.</p>
<p>At the monthly meeting of the court of guardians, held on
December 1st, 1846, Mr. G. Gedge moved a <a
name="page414"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 414</span>resolution
of which he had given notice at the previous court, in respect to
a national rate, and he urged the usual arguments in favour of
that measure.&nbsp; He wished the support of the court to a
petition to be presented to Parliament during the following
session, for the total repeal of the mode of rating to the relief
of the poor, then in operation, and the substitution of a
national rate.&nbsp; He believed that public opinion was now
fixed on this question, and that a national rate must come.&nbsp;
A petition was adopted, <i>nem con.</i></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1847</b>.&nbsp; A meeting of the city operatives was held
on Wednesday, March 23rd, in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, for the
purpose of petitioning Parliament to abolish the law of
settlement then in operation, and to establish a national poor
rate.&nbsp; The meeting was numerously attended by working men,
who manifested a great interest in the question.&nbsp; Several of
them delivered speeches against the law of settlement and in
favour of a national rate, and a petition to Parliament was
adopted.&nbsp; Mr. Gedge spoke at some length in favour of the
measure, which he believed would be carried.</p>
<p>A public meeting of the citizens was held on December the 2nd,
1847, to consider the evils arising from the alteration of the
law of settlement.&nbsp; The mayor (G. L. Coleman, Esq.)
presided, and many influential gentlemen addressed the meeting in
support of resolutions deprecating the alteration in the law, and
in favour of a more equitable system than <a
name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 415</span>that in
operation.&nbsp; Sir S. M. Peto, M.P. for the city expressed his
concurrence, and the resolution was carried unanimously.&nbsp;
Subsequently, several meetings were held in Norwich in favour of
a national rate.&nbsp; During the same year, also, an association
was formed in London, having the same object in view; and,
eventually, the movement resulted in the passing of an Act of
Parliament, by which a union poor rate was established in every
county in England.&nbsp; This has proved to be a vast improvement
of the old system, and a great advance in the direction of a
national rate, but still the poor rate is levied on real property
only.&nbsp; The most equitable system would be for every man to
pay according to his ability, whether he be a landowner, a
shipowner, a houseowner, a fund-holder, or an artisan.</p>
<p>Before the Removal Act passed, the Norwich guardians were
quite aware of the effect it would have on the city.&nbsp; In
order to prove that their apprehensions were well founded, they
caused a census to be taken in the city and county of those
paying a yearly rental of &pound;6 and under, and an inquiry to
be instituted as to the settlement of the tenants of those
houses.&nbsp; They found, after a full investigation, that more
than a third of the houses were occupied by persons not having a
settlement in Norwich, but in other districts.&nbsp; The
operation of the act was to throw the expense of the maintenance
of such persons on the city, at an estimated cost of &pound;5000
yearly.&nbsp; This was represented to the government, who paid no
attention to it, and the Act passed nevertheless.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Murder of the Norwich
Recorder</span>.</h4>
<p>Late on the night of November 28th, 1848, the city was
startled by the intelligence of the murder of Isaac Jermy, Esq.,
the Recorder of Norwich, and his son.&nbsp; His son&rsquo;s wife
(Mrs. Jermy Jermy), and her servant, Eliza Chastney, were also
fired at and wounded by the same murderous hand.&nbsp; The first
<a name="page417"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 417</span>news of
these murders and attempted murders excited universal
horror.&nbsp; They appeared to be so inhuman and atrocious, that
public feeling was wrought up to the highest pitch; and all the
reports published in the local and metropolitan journals were
read with the greatest avidity.&nbsp; James Blomfield Rush, a
farmer, well known in Norfolk, and a tenant under Mr. Jermy, was
at once suspected and apprehended.&nbsp; He was examined before
the magistrates, committed, tried, found guilty, and
executed.&nbsp; We give a short account of this terrible
tragedy.</p>
<p>Mr. Jermy, with his wife and family, lived at a mansion called
Stanfield Hall, about two miles distant from Wymondham, and Rush
lived at a neighbouring farm house, known as Potash Farm.&nbsp;
The Preston family, of which the recorder was a descendant,
originally came from the village of Preston, in the hundred of
Babergh, Suffolk, and settled at Beeston St. Lawrence, in the
hundred of Tunstead, in Norfolk.&nbsp; In 1837, the Rev. G.
Preston died, leaving his son, the recorder, heir to Stanfield
and his other entailed property.&nbsp; The recorder, previous to
his father&rsquo;s death, was called Mr. Preston; but soon after
that event, he took the necessary steps for complying with the
stipulation in the will of Mr. Wm. Jermy, from whom the property
had descended, that the possessor of the estate should assume his
name and arms, and accordingly he took the name and arms of Jermy
by license from the crown.&nbsp; He was a county magistrate and
one of the chairmen at quarter sessions, recorder for Norwich,
and a director of the Norwich Union <a name="page418"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 418</span>Insurance Office.&nbsp; Indeed, he
had been all his life closely connected with the city.</p>
<p>There had been some disputes relative to the Stanfield
property.&nbsp; It was said that one of the male relatives of
William Jermy had disposed of his reversionary interest in these
estates for the trifling consideration of &pound;20.&nbsp; This
occurred in the year 1754.&nbsp; In June 1838, when the Rev.
George Pearson&rsquo;s furniture and library at Stanfield Hall
were advertised for sale, a person named Thomas Jermy, a grandson
of John Jermy, with a cousin of his, named John Larner, put in a
claim to the estate, and served notices both upon Mr. Jermy and
the auctioneer to stop the sale.&nbsp; Larner then attempted to
obtain possession of the hall, but was shortly afterwards ejected
by Rush, (who was then acting as bailiff for Mr. Jermy,) with a
party of labourers.&nbsp; Larner then cut down some timber and
carted it away; and he and his party were apprehended for the
offence, but he himself was acquitted, though his accomplices
were convicted in penalties.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards placards
were posted in the neighbourhood, stating their intention to
obtain forcible possession.&nbsp; This they attempted to do, but
they were apprehended and committed to the assizes.&nbsp; They
pleaded <i>guilty</i>, and were sentenced to various periods of
imprisonment.</p>
<p>Rush, being aware of all these circumstances, may have thought
that he could perpetrate the murder in disguise, and that
suspicion would rest on those who claimed the estate.&nbsp; It
was stated and believed that he was a near relation to the
recorder, who, when he <a name="page419"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 419</span>came into possession of his estates,
employed Rush as his steward, but rescinded his leases, having
found that they were illegal.&nbsp; This created the first ill
feeling between the parties.&nbsp; The recorder granted new
leases to Rush, but, as the latter alleged, at higher rent.&nbsp;
Rush soon afterwards took the Potash Farm in Hethel, under Mr.
Calver; this farm adjoining the Stanfield estate, and being very
convenient for his occupation.&nbsp; It being for sale, Mr. Jermy
wished to become the purchaser, and he authorised Rush, who fixed
the value at &pound;3,500, to buy it for him.&nbsp; Rush attended
the sale, and having bid &pound;3,500 for Mr. Jermy, bade
&pound;3,750 for himself.&nbsp; The recorder, though much annoyed
by this transaction at first, was induced to lend Rush the money,
on mortgage, to complete the purchase.&nbsp; The equity of
redemption, or the ownership, therefore belonged to him.&nbsp; A
number of mortgage deeds were executed, the last of which was
dated September 28th, 1844, and it recited several prior
mortgages.</p>
<p>The effect of it was, that a sum of &pound;5000 in all was
charged upon the estate, by way of mortgage, in favour of the
recorder, and it contained a provision that the money was to
remain on the security of that estate <i>until the</i>
30<i>th</i> <i>November</i>, 1848.&nbsp; The interest on the
&pound;5000 was 4 per cent. or &pound;200 per annum, and Rush
became tenant so as to enable the recorder to distrain for
rent.&nbsp; Rush now held three farms, and in October, 1847, he
was in arrear of rent for the Stanfield farm, and the recorder
put in some distresses.&nbsp; Rush being ejected went to live at
Potash farm house.&nbsp; <a name="page420"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 420</span>Mr. Jermy also brought an action
against Rush for breach of covenants.&nbsp; This action was tried
at the March assizes, 1848, and it, as well as the previous
distresses, seemed to have occasioned rancourous feelings in
Rush&rsquo;s mind towards Mr. Jermy.&nbsp; He published a
pamphlet which professed to be a report of the trial, calling Mr.
Jermy a villain, and stating that he had no right to Stanfield
Hall.&nbsp; This showed that Rush cherished malignant feelings
towards his victim.</p>
<p>Rush appears to have for some time premeditated the murder of
Mr. Jermy and his whole family; and he ultimately resolved to
carry out a deep-laid scheme, both of murder and robbery.&nbsp;
He got a young woman named Emily Sandford into his service as
governess, and seduced her.&nbsp; He then employed her to draw up
some quasi legal documents, as she could write like a
lawyer&rsquo;s clerk.&nbsp; According to one of these documents,
signed &ldquo;Isaac Jermy,&rdquo; that gentleman gave up all
claim on Rush, if the latter gave up all papers and documents
relating to the Stanfield estate.&nbsp; The signature was of
course forged.&nbsp; After the murder these documents were found
concealed under the floor of a bed-room in Rush&rsquo;s house,
ready to be produced had he escaped suspicion.</p>
<p>Rush&rsquo;s conduct before the murders had been
observed.&nbsp; He had taken every precaution to throw off
suspicion.&nbsp; During the latter part of November, he had been
in the habit of going out at night, pretending to be on the
look-out for poachers.&nbsp; He ordered a quantity of straw to be
littered down from his homestead to the fields towards Stanfield
Hall.&nbsp; <a name="page421"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
421</span>A portion of the path which had never before been
littered with straw, was then littered by his direction, and the
straw ceased where the green sward began, so that he could walk
from his house towards the recorder&rsquo;s mansion, without any
danger of his footsteps being traced.&nbsp; Before November 28th,
he had caused everybody to leave his house except Emily Sandford
and a lad named Savory.&nbsp; On that day he returned home about
5 p.m., and asked when the dinner would be ready.&nbsp; Emily
Sandford said it would be ready soon, upon which he remarked,
&ldquo;There is just time for me to go into the garden and fire
off my gun;&rdquo; and he went into the garden and discharged his
gun accordingly.&nbsp; This was intended to account for his gun
having been recently used.&nbsp; He had bought a double-barrelled
gun in London the last time he was there.&nbsp; After tea he
appeared to be extremely agitated.&nbsp; He went up-stairs to his
bedroom and put on a disguise; one part of which was for the
whole person, being in fact a widow&rsquo;s dress, which was
quite new.&nbsp; Another part was a black crape bonnet with a
double frill hanging by it; and the frill rendered it difficult
for any one to discern the wearer&rsquo;s features.&nbsp; He
enveloped himself with a large cloak, armed himself with his
double-barrelled gun, and went out to do his work of murder
between seven and eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Nobody saw him leave
the house.&nbsp; The night was dark and windy and well suited for
the deeds of an assassin.</p>
<p>Soon after eight o&rsquo;clock, the recorder&rsquo;s dinner
being over, he was sitting alone in the dining-room, little <a
name="page422"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 422</span>dreaming of
the doom that awaited him and his son.&nbsp; His son and his
son&rsquo;s wife, who had retired to the drawing-room, were about
to partake of tea and to amuse themselves with a game of picquet,
the cards being on the table.&nbsp; Mr. Jermy was in the habit of
going outside the hall after dinner, and on this evening he left
the dining-room and walked to a porch in front of the
mansion.&nbsp; Rush, who knew the recorder&rsquo;s habits and
expected him to come out, was standing near the porch in disguise
holding his loaded gun in his hand.&nbsp; As soon as Mr. Jermy
reached the porch, Rush presented his gun, fired, and shot him
through the heart.&nbsp; He fell backwards, groaned, and
instantly expired.&nbsp; Rush immediately ran to the side door,
entered, and proceeded along the passages leading to the
staircase hall.&nbsp; He passed close to the butler, who,
affrighted at the appearance of an armed man in disguise, retired
to his pantry.&nbsp; Rush passed on to the door opening into the
staircase hall.&nbsp; Mr. Jermy, jun., who had heard the report
of a gun, opened the door at that very moment.&nbsp; They met;
Rush drew back, presented the gun, and fired; and young Mr. Jermy
fell dead in the hall.&nbsp; The assassin then passed on into the
dining-room, no doubt with the intention of exterminating the
whole family.&nbsp; Mrs. Jermy, still in the drawing-room, on
hearing the second report, immediately went into the hall, and
passed over the dead body of her husband.&nbsp; Eliza Chastney,
one of the female servants, on hearing her mistress screaming for
help, ran up to her, and holding her by the waist cried out,
&ldquo;My dear mistress, what is the matter?&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page423"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 423</span>At this
moment, Rush came out of the dining-room, and seeing the two
women opposite to him, levelled his weapon and fired twice,
wounding Mrs. Jermy in the arm and her servant in the leg.&nbsp;
The murderer then made his escape by the side door, leaving
death, misery, and woe behind him.&nbsp; He did not escape,
however, before some of the servants had made their observations
of him.&nbsp; Eliza Chastney had marked the man, and she
afterwards identified him at the trial.&nbsp; Strange to say,
several persons were standing at the gate close to the bridge,
heard the reports of a gun, and heard the alarm bell ringing, but
did not imagine that anything serious had happened.&nbsp; Some
people are so stolid that an earthquake would scarcely arouse
them.&nbsp; A man who had been employed in the stables, hearing
the reports, thought that the hall was attacked by a band of
ruffians, went to the back, swam over the moat which surrounds
the hall, and ran to the house of a neighbouring farmer (Mr.
Colman), and having obtained a horse rode to Wymondham, spreading
the alarm as he went.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the scene at Stanfield Hall was one of utter
dismay.&nbsp; The cook had fled to the coach house with little
Miss Jermy, the daughter of Mr. Jermy, jun.&nbsp; The cowardly
butler, who might have seized the assassin in the passage, rushed
to Mr. Gower&rsquo;s, another farmer, for assistance.&nbsp; The
maid servants conveyed their wounded mistress upstairs to
bed.&nbsp; Eliza Chastney was lying wounded on the ground; Mr.
Jermy, sen., was lying dead in the porch, everybody being then
uncertain as to his <a name="page424"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 424</span>fate; and Mr. Jermy, jun., was lying
dead in the hall.&nbsp; Mr. Colman, Mr. Gower, and Mr.
Gower&rsquo;s two sons, having received some vague information,
had hurried to the hall, and were the first who discovered what
had happened.&nbsp; The servants were all panic-stricken.</p>
<p>What was the conduct of the assassin after the murders?&nbsp;
Emily Sandford, whom he had seduced, though at first she told a
false story, revealed it all in the course of the inquest and the
examinations before the magistrates.&nbsp; Between nine and ten
o&rsquo;clock on that same night, Rush&rsquo;s knock was heard at
his own door.&nbsp; Emily Sandford went to the door to open it,
but without a light, and she did not see him come in.&nbsp; He
went upstairs to his own room, put off his disguise which was
found there by the police, and in a short time came down again
without his boots and coat.&nbsp; He told Emily Sandford to make
haste and put out her fire and go to bed; and before he left her
he said, &ldquo;If any inquiry is made about me, say I was not
out more than ten minutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; She followed, after she
had put out the fire, and asked him where she should sleep.&nbsp;
He told her that she was to sleep in her own room; that being the
first night she had done so for a long time.&nbsp; She went to
bed, and between two and three o&rsquo;clock in the morning Rush,
who had heard voices outside, rapped at the door of her room and
desired her to let him in; and she did so.&nbsp; He came
trembling to her bedside and said, &ldquo;Now you be firm, and
remember that I was out only ten minutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was
extremely agitated and inquired what was the matter; but he would
only tell her that <a name="page425"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
425</span>she might hear of something in the morning.&nbsp;
Taking hold of his hand she observed that he trembled
violently.&nbsp; Next morning the police, who had watched the
house all night, apprehended him, and on the same day he was
examined before the magistrates.&nbsp; Emily Sandford also
underwent a lengthened examination, and persisted in stating that
Rush was out only a quarter of an hour on the previous night; but
at the inquest subsequently held by Mr. Press at Wymondham, she
confessed that her first statement was false, admitting that Rush
did not return home till after nine o&rsquo;clock, and that he
told her to say he had been out only ten minutes.&nbsp; She also
gave evidence as to all that passed between her and Rush that
night, as already related.</p>
<p>On the morning after the murder the police searched Potash
farm house, and found two double-barrelled guns in the closet in
Rush&rsquo;s bed-room, but these were not the weapons he
used.&nbsp; The gun he had used was afterwards found under a
manure heap.&nbsp; In the house the police found a black dress, a
grey and black frontlet, female wig, and a long black veil, as
for a female head-dress.&nbsp; These were hidden in a closet in
Rush&rsquo;s bed-room.&nbsp; Concealed under the floor of a
closet a number of documents were also found, which turned out to
be the forged deeds before alluded to.&nbsp; These formed an
extraordinary link in the case, and after repeated examinations
the prisoner was committed to the assizes for trial.&nbsp; The
bodies of his victims were consigned to their last resting place
at Wymondham on December 5th, in the presence of a vast concourse
of spectators.</p>
<p><a name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 426</span>The
trial of Rush excited universal interest all over England,
Scotland, and Ireland.&nbsp; It commenced at the Shirehall,
Norwich, on Thursday, March 29th, 1849, before Baron Rolfe.&nbsp;
It continued six days, and each day the court was crowded to
excess.&nbsp; He was not defended by counsel.&nbsp; Mr. Sergeant
Byles stated the case for the prosecution, and then called a
number of witnesses who clearly proved the facts.&nbsp; Having in
the preceding part of this narrative stated all the particulars,
it is unnecessary to give the evidence.&nbsp; The documents which
were found in a secret place under the floor of the bed-room
closet in the prisoner&rsquo;s house were produced, and several
of them were proved to be forgeries, which, if carried into
effect after the recorder&rsquo;s death, would have placed the
prisoner in a very good position with respect to the farms which
he occupied, and would have rid him of all his liabilities.&nbsp;
A powerful motive for the commission of the murders was therefore
apparent.&nbsp; The servants at the hall, who had seen the
disguised armed man there, all deposed that they believed the
prisoner to be the man, as they had known him before, and as they
had recognised him by his height, form, walk, and gait.&nbsp;
Eliza Chastney, who had been severely wounded by the assassin,
was brought into court on a couch, attended by medical men.&nbsp;
When asked if she saw the assassin in court, she pointed to Rush
and said, &ldquo;That is the man.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had seen him
several times at the hall.&nbsp; When he fired at her, she saw
the whole form of his head and shoulders, and she knew no one
else having a similar appearance.&nbsp; Emily Sandford <a
name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 427</span>entered the
box apparently in a weak state.&nbsp; She was examined at great
length, and she stated with much clearness all that had passed
between her and Rush and other parties in reference to the
documents produced.&nbsp; She also gave a full account of the
prisoner&rsquo;s conduct on the night of the 28th, as already
narrated.</p>
<p>When the prisoner commenced his cross-examination of this
witness there was a profound silence in the court, all present
being anxious to know how he would treat the unfortunate female
whom he had seduced, and who had given evidence against
him.&nbsp; He appeared to be under the influence of strong
emotion, so much so as at times, as to stifle his utterance; and
he was frequently on the verge of bursting into tears, yet he
mastered his feelings, and put his questions mildly in an assumed
endearing manner, trying to rouse any affection that she might
have left for him.&nbsp; She gave her answers in a low tone, and
sometimes weeping, which excited the pity of the
spectators.&nbsp; Nearly all the questions put by the prisoner
were irrelevant to her evidence in chief, but not all the
blandishments and frequent adjurations of the questioner could
elicit answers to suit his purpose.&nbsp; At length he put
questions which roused her indignation, and she reproached him
for his perfidy in not marrying her as he promised.&nbsp; If he
had done so, she could not have given evidence against him.&nbsp;
Four days were occupied with the case for the prosecution.&nbsp;
On the fifth day the prisoner commenced his defence, and he spoke
on that and the following day fourteen hours without making any
impression whatever in his <a name="page428"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 428</span>favour.&nbsp; He began by admitting
a guilty knowledge that something was about to take place in the
hall on that night.&nbsp; He said parties had consulted him as to
the expediency of taking forcible possession of the hall, as had
been done some years before.&nbsp; He advised them not to do so,
but still he apprehended that something serious would
happen.&nbsp; He left his house at eight or half-past eight
o&rsquo;clock on the night of the murders, and he went to the
boundary of his own land.&nbsp; When he got to the fence leading
to the hall, he waited a few minutes and thought he would go back
as he felt ill, but at that moment he heard the report of a gun
or pistol in a direct line from the hall.&nbsp; He then heard two
more, and was struck with amazement, as the parties to whom he
alluded had always said, if they took firearms it would only be
to intimidate, not to use them.&nbsp; He then heard the bell rung
violently, and he hastened back to his house as quickly as he
could, and he went through the garden into the house.&nbsp;
Having given this account of himself on that night, he proceeded
to comment on the evidence with a view to show
contradictions.</p>
<p>Mr. Sergeant Byles replied, showing that the prisoner had only
strengthened the case against him.</p>
<p>The learned judge summed up in a lucid manner, the jury soon
returned a verdict of guilty of wilful murder, the prisoner was
sentenced to be hung, and the dread sentence was executed on the
bridge in front of Norwich Castle on the morning of Saturday,
April 21st, in the presence of many thousands of
spectators.&nbsp; The unhappy man remained impenitent to the
last.</p>

Leading Events (<i>continued</i>).</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> this time the two parties in
the council became nearly equal in numbers, and the Liberals
found a difficulty in selecting a mayor and sheriff every year
from their own party.&nbsp; They accordingly proposed that each
party should nominate a mayor and sheriff alternately.&nbsp; In
1848 S. Bignold, Esq., was nominated a second time, and elected
unanimously to serve the office of mayor.&nbsp; From that time to
the present the chief magistrate and the sheriff have been
selected from each party alternately.&nbsp; This has also led to
the members of the various committees being selected so as to
represent all parties fairly, and the former exclusive system has
been discontinued.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1850</b>.&nbsp; In 1850, in consequence of a memorial to
the General Board of Health, established under the (1848) Public
Health Act, Mr. Lee, a civil engineer and government inspector,
came to Norwich and commenced an inquiry respecting the sanitary
state of the city.&nbsp; The inquiry lasted a fortnight, and Mr.
Lee <a name="page430"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
430</span>heard evidence given by all the officials and other
parties.&nbsp; He afterwards prepared a very elaborate report,
showing that the supply of water was insufficient, that the
drainage was defective, and that many causes of preventible
disease existed.&nbsp; He advised the application of the Public
Health Act, which was ultimately done.&nbsp; A company had been
previously formed with a large capital, and had constructed works
for the supply of water from the river Wensum to all parts of the
city.&nbsp; The abundant supply of pure water proved very
beneficial to the health of the inhabitants, and entirely
relieved the Local Board of Health from all trouble on that
point, and they had only to contract for the supply of water to
water the roads and streets during the summer months.</p>
<p>In January of this year Jenny Lind gave two concerts in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, which was quite filled, at high prices, by
fashionable audiences, more than 2000 being present at each
concert.&nbsp; The proceeds, amounting to &pound;1253, were
generously given by the celebrated songstress for the foundation
of the Jenny Lind Infirmary for Children in Pottergate
Street.&nbsp; It was established in 1853, and visited by the
Queen of Song in 1856, when she was so much pleased with the
management that she added &pound;50 to her former gifts.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1851</b>.&nbsp; The Great Exhibition of 1851, which was
opened in May, attracted thousands of the citizens to London,
where many of them spent weeks in viewing the wonders at the
Crystal Palace.&nbsp; Norwich manufacturers sent many specimens
of their shawls and <a name="page431"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 431</span>textile fabrics.&nbsp; Amongst the
exhibitors were Messrs C. and F. Bolingbroke and Jones; Messrs.
Middleton and Answorth; Messrs. Towler, Rowling, and Allen;
Messrs. Willett and Nephew; Messrs. Clabburn, Sons, and Crisp;
and Messrs. Grout and Co.; all of whose productions were much
admired and commended.&nbsp; A very large number of our
operatives were conveyed by special train free to London to see
the Exhibition, where they had an opportunity of inspecting the
best productions of art of the whole world.&nbsp; This wonderful
exhibition was supposed to be the harbinger of universal peace,
but it was soon followed by the Russian war, which greatly
depressed the trade of the city and of the whole country.&nbsp;
It cost about a hundred millions of money, destroyed thousands of
brave soldiers, and spread a general gloom over the minds of
men.&nbsp; It ended in the fall of Sebastopol, and the triumph of
the allied armies.&nbsp; Russian aggression was stopped for a
time; but was the rotten Turkish empire worth the waste of men
and money?</p>
<p>The census, which was taken in this year, showed that the
population of Norwich had increased to 68,713 persons who were in
a comparatively prosperous condition, for trade was good and
provisions were cheap.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1853</b>.&nbsp; On November 1st, S. Bignold, Esq., was
elected mayor of Norwich for the third time, and he filled the
office with great approbation throughout the year.&nbsp; He lent
the money required in the first instance for the new building
erected for the Free Library and <a name="page432"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 432</span>the School of Art, and which
afforded additional accommodation for the Museum and Literary
Institution.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1854</b>.&nbsp; At a meeting of the corporation held on May
4th, the mayor, S. Bignold, Esq., in the chair, he announced that
Her Majesty had been graciously pleased on the previous day to
confer the honour of knighthood upon him, on the occasion of his
presenting the addresses, voted by the council on the 20th of
April last, pledging their loyalty to the Queen when Her Majesty
declared war against Russia.&nbsp; It was thereupon resolved
unanimously, on the motion of A. A. H. Beckwith, Esq.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That this council beg to offer their hearty
congratulations to Sir S. Bignold, the mayor of Norwich, on his
accession to the dignity which Her Majesty has graciously
bestowed upon him, and wish him many years to enjoy the honour so
worthily conferred.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1856</b>.&nbsp; The New Cemetery was opened by the Board of
Health, and the east side of it was consecrated by the
bishop.&nbsp; The other side was assigned to the
Nonconformists.&nbsp; Since then about 20,000 bodies have been
interred in the spacious area of thirty-five acres next the
Earlham Road.&nbsp; The grounds have been well laid out and
planted with trees and shrubs.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1857</b>.&nbsp; The Yare Preservation and Anglers&rsquo;
Society was founded, for the improvement of the angling in the
rivers Wensum and Yare.&nbsp; This society has done <a
name="page433"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 433</span>good
service for the lovers of angling on the two rivers, which
formerly abounded with fish near Norwich.&nbsp; But on account of
the pollution of the stream, anglers are obliged to go down as
far as Coldham Hall or Cantley to fish with any prospect of
success.</p>
<p>The Russian war having been brought to a close, peace was
celebrated here with great rejoicings and illuminations.&nbsp;
Major General Windham, &ldquo;the hero of the Redan,&rdquo;
visited the city, and a grand banquet was given to him in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, where he delivered an eloquent address on
the events of the war and its successful termination.</p>
<p>In August the annual congress of the British
Arch&aelig;ological Association met in Norwich.&nbsp; Meetings
were held in the Guildhall, St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, the Public
Library, and other buildings.&nbsp; Addresses were delivered by
Professor Willis, Mr. Britton, and many other gentlemen.&nbsp;
The members and friends visited the Cathedral, where Professor
Willis gave a description of the edifice.&nbsp; They also made
excursions to Ely, Dereham, Binham, Walsingham, and other places
of interest.&nbsp; On their return to Norwich they dined together
at the Swan Inn.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1858</b>.&nbsp; The Local Government Act came into
operation, and gave the corporation full power to carry out all
necessary improvements.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1859</b>.&nbsp; On November 19th, the Norwich Battalion of
Volunteers was formally enrolled, 300 strong, in <a
name="page434"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 434</span>three
companies, under the command of Colonel Brett, a highly-esteemed
officer.&nbsp; The other officers were, Capt. Middleton of the
first company, Capt. H. S. Patteson of the second company, and
Captain Hay Gurney of the third company.&nbsp; The force
gradually increased in number till the battalion became 530
strong, in six companies.&nbsp; Colonel Brett resigned on account
of ill health, and Colonel Black was appointed to the chief
command; next to him Major Patteson; Capt. Henry Morgan first
company, Capt. John Steward second, Capt. Peter Hansell third,
Capt. Charles Foster fourth, Capt. J. B. Morgan fifth, Capt. E.
Field sixth; Lieut. H. Pulley, Quarter Master; John Friar Clarke,
Quarter Master Sergeant; T. W. Crosse, Surgeon; Rev. F. Meyrick,
Chaplain.&nbsp; The corporation subsequently granted a piece of
land at the north-west corner of Chapel Field, and a company of
shareholders built the Drill Hall for the use of the members of
the corps, which has the reputation of being very efficient.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1861</b>.&nbsp; A meeting was held on January 10th to
consider the best means of relieving the distress which had for
some time prevailed, owing to the depression of trade; and within
a month, more than &pound;4,000 were raised for the relief of the
poor.&nbsp; Since then the weavers have gradually found
employment in some other branches of industry, especially the
boot and shoe manufacture, which has greatly increased.&nbsp;
Hundreds of operatives are also employed in iron manufactures,
and in making machines for agricultural and horticultural
purposes.</p>
<p><a name="page435"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 435</span>This

afforded some of our city manufacturers another opportunity of
exhibiting their productions, and making known the skill of our
artisans.&nbsp; Messrs. Clabburn, Son, and Crisp won the gold
medal for their superfine fillover shawls, which are made by a
patented process, so as to display a perfect design on each
side.&nbsp; Messrs. C. and F. Bolingbroke and Jones gained a
medal for <a name="page437"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Messrs. Towler, Rowling, and Allen obtained honourable
mention.&nbsp; So much for what are usually regarded as the
staple products of Norwich.&nbsp; But Norwich won for itself the
admiration of the world in some other matters.&nbsp; Messrs.
Barnard and Bishop, for instance, were spoken of far and wide for
their splendid park gates in ornamental wrought iron, which were
subsequently purchased and presented to the Prince of Wales, and
now adorn one of the entrances to His Royal Highness&rsquo;s park
at Sandringham.&nbsp; Of course also Messrs. Colman took high
prizes for their world-renowned mustard and starch&mdash;the
medal given them for mustard being the only medal granted in the
United Kingdom for this article of commerce.&nbsp; As publishers,
Messrs. Jarrold and Sons received honourable mention for their

<h4><span class="smcap">Norwich Union</span>.</h4>
<p>In this year the Court of Guardians of this city obtained a
new act of parliament for an improved management of the poor, and
repealing all former acts.&nbsp; Under the new act the present
Board of Guardians is constituted with a reduced number of
guardians, and the whole management is more in accordance with
the New Poor Law system.&nbsp; Norwich is now a union of
parishes, divided into districts, each having medical
attendants.&nbsp; By this new act all former acts, including the
Norwich Small Tenements Act of 1847, were repealed, and the city
was brought under the operation of the General Poor Law, and all
other statute and laws from time to time in force with respect to
the poor in England.&nbsp; The union is now divided into sixteen
districts, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>The board consists of forty-two guardians, elected for the
sixteen districts as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>For each of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, eleventh,
and twelfth districts, two guardians; for each of the sixth,
seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and sixteenth districts,
three guardians; for the eighth district five guardians.&nbsp;
For the purpose of this act with respect to the limits of the
palace of the bishop of Norwich, the same are deemed to be
locally situated within the parish of St. Mary in the Marsh.</p>
<p>The following are the qualifications for voting in the
election of guardians:&mdash;</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Occupiers of rateable property who respectively are
rated in respect thereof on a gross assessment of ten pounds and
upwards.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp; Owners of rateable property, who respectively are
rated in respect thereof on a net assessment of ten pounds or
upwards.&nbsp; Provided, that where two or more persons are
jointly rated, one only of them shall be entitled to vote, and <a
name="page440"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 440</span>in every
case the rating shall have been in the last two rates, each made
at least two months before the day of election, and in respect of
property in the district in which the person votes, and the rates
shall have been paid at least fourteen days before the day of
election.</p>
<p>At every election of guardians the rate-payers voting have
votes in accordance with the following scale:&mdash;</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; If rated at &pound;10 and under &pound;25, one
vote.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp; If rated at &pound;25 and under &pound;50, two
votes.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; If rated at &pound;50 and under &pound;75, three

<p>E.&nbsp; If rated at &pound;100 and under &pound;150, five
votes.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; If rated at &pound;150 or upwards, six votes.</p>
<p>And no rate-payer at any election of guardians for any one and
the same district have more than six votes.</p>
<p>All the compounding provisions of the act were abolished by
the Reform Act of 1867.</p>
<p>The old court of guardians had the management of lunatic
paupers, who were maintained in an asylum in St.
Augustine&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Great care appears to have been taken of
them, and many of them were cured, more in proportion than in any
other town.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the lunacy commissioners who
visited the asylum reported that the place was unhealthy and
unfit for lunatics, and recommended, or rather demanded that a
new asylum should be built in a more healthy situation.&nbsp;
This the old court of guardians considered to be quite
unnecessary, and the whole matter was transferred to the council
under the Lunatic Asylums <a name="page441"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 441</span>Act of 1853, that body having the
option of taking the matter in hand.&nbsp; The council, already
over-loaded with municipal business, Board of Health business,
drainage, paving, lighting, watering the roads, &amp;c., actually
undertook the management of the lunatic paupers, in 1863.&nbsp;
After many discussions a majority of the members decided that a
new asylum was unnecessary, and refused to build one.&nbsp; The
Lunacy Commissioners, however, made a strong report to the
Secretary of State on the subject, who sent down an order to the
council to build an asylum.&nbsp; Since then land has been
purchased for its site, which is likely to cost from
&pound;30,000 to &pound;40,000!</p>

<p><b>1864</b>.&nbsp; In 1864 the operatives made a very laudable
effort to improve their depressed condition by establishing an
&ldquo;Industrial Weavers&rsquo; Co-operative Society,&rdquo; and
held many meetings to promote that object.&nbsp; The Rev. C.
Caldwell, and other gentlemen, advocated their cause.&nbsp; The
society was supported by donations, and J. H. Gurney, Esq.,
advanced a sum which had been left by his father for the benefit
of the weavers, the principal with interest amounting to
&pound;1100.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1865</b>.&nbsp; The Norfolk Chamber of Agriculture was
instituted, and frequent meetings of the members have been held
at the Norfolk Hotel, Norwich.&nbsp; The objects of the chamber
are to watch over all measures affecting agriculture both in and
out of parliament, to co-operate with the General Chamber
thereon, and to <a name="page442"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
442</span>take such action as may be for the benefit of
agriculturists.&nbsp; At the meetings of the members interesting
questions have been discussed, and C. S. Read, Esq., M.P. for
East Norfolk, has generally presided, and given much valuable
information.</p>
<p>The most important event in this diocese of late years was the
holding of a Church Congress in Norwich.&nbsp; A preliminary
meeting to consider the proposal was held in the Clerical Rooms
on Saturday, December 10th, 1864.&nbsp; When this was announced
there was no little apprehension in Low Church circles, but the
proposal was approved by most of the clergy, and they requested
the Lord Bishop to preside over the Congress, which was held in
October, 1865.&nbsp; After some delay his lordship reluctantly
consented, and never before was there such a gathering of clergy
in the city.&nbsp; St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall was filled every day
for a week in October, 1865.&nbsp; High churchmen throughout the
country made it a point of duty to attend the congress; and the
proceedings at the daily meetings were of a very interesting
character to churchmen generally.&nbsp; Addresses were delivered
every day on very important subjects; and the bible history was
ably vindicated against the objections of geologists and
freethinkers.&nbsp; The church as an establishment was well
defended by her champions.&nbsp; Three local newspapers were
published daily, containing full reports of the
proceedings.&nbsp; Dr. Pusey read a discourse of great interest
in defence of the Old Testament narratives.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Royal Visit to Norwich</span>.</h4>
<p>In November the Prince and Princess of Wales travelled from
their seat at Sandringham to Cossey on a visit to Lord and Lady
Stafford, who entertained their Royal Highnesses in a princely
style.&nbsp; Their Royal Highnesses, during their sojourn at
Cossey, visited this city, entering by way of the Dereham Road
and St. Giles&rsquo; Road, and passing under triumphal arches
amid the acclamations of thousands of the citizens, it being a
general holiday.&nbsp; They stopped at the Guildhall and received
an address from the corporation.&nbsp; Then they proceeded to St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall and attended a morning concert of the musical
festival.&nbsp; Their Royal Highnesses, on leaving the hall, rode
along the principal streets, through the Market Place, and up St.
Stephen&rsquo;s to the Chapel Field, where they were joyously
received by the Manchester Unity of Odd Fellows, and where they
planted two trees in memory of their visit.&nbsp; Their Royal
Highnesses thence proceeded to the new Drill Hall, which the
Prince of Wales formally opened.&nbsp; After this ceremony their
Royal Highnesses returned to Cossey Hall.&nbsp; They were
accompanied by the Queen of Denmark (mother of the Princess of
Wales), and by Prince Alfred (the Duke of Edinburgh).&nbsp; In
the evening the city was brilliantly illuminated.</p>

<p><b>1867</b>.&nbsp; The Norwich Industrial Exhibition was held
for six weeks, from August 15th till October 20th, <a
name="page444"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 444</span>1867, in
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; About 1000 exhibitors sent
specimens of works of art and useful articles, which quite filled
the hall.&nbsp; Hundreds of splendid paintings were lent for the
occasion, and the show attracted many thousands of
visitors.&nbsp; The industrial part of the exhibition was most
creditable to the working men of Norwich, many of whom gained
medals and money prizes for the best specimens of useful and
ornamental articles.&nbsp; The mayor, F. E. Watson, Esq.,
distributed the prizes on November 5th.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><b>1868</b>.&nbsp; The great event of the year 1868 was the
meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science
in the city.&nbsp; It commenced on August 19th and continued till
the 26th.&nbsp; The old city was filled with distinguished
visitors from all parts of Europe; and the hotels, inns, and
lodging houses were crowded with strangers.&nbsp; Norwich gave a
hospitable welcome to the Society.&nbsp; Dr. Hooker, who by
association and descent is a Norfolk man, delivered the inaugural
address.&nbsp; The various scientific sections held daily
meetings at different public places.&nbsp; The proceedings were
reported in daily issues of the <i>Norfolk News</i> and the
<i>Norfolk Chronicle</i>, and also in the regular issues of the
<i>Norwich Mercury</i>.</p>
<p>On November the 9th, J. J. Colman, Esq., retired from the
office of mayor, and E. K. Harvey, Esq., was elected as his
successor; John Robison, Esq., was at the same time chosen as
sheriff, as successor to Robert Fitch, Esq.&nbsp; As this is the
last act of the council which we shall have to chronicle, we take
<a name="page445"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 445</span>the
opportunity of adding a few words on the present state of the
corporation.&nbsp; By the Municipal Reform Act all previous
charters remain in force, except so far as they are rendered
inconsistent with the provisions of that act, and the city is now
divided into eight wards, and incorporated under the style or
title of the &ldquo;Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the city
and borough of Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; The corporate body consists
of sixteen aldermen and forty-eight councillors.&nbsp; The mayor
is chosen annually on the 9th of November from the members of the
council, who also on the same day choose the sheriff from the
same body, or from persons qualified to vote for councillors, and
who are eligible to the office of councillor.&nbsp; The members
of the council are chosen annually on November 1st by the
inhabitant householders of three years&rsquo; successive
occupation, the freemen having been disfranchised for municipal
purposes.&nbsp; The aldermen are elected by the council, and go
out of office every three years.&nbsp; Committees of the council
are appointed for conducting the business of the corporate
body.&nbsp; The corporation is possessed of various estates,
tolls, and dues, the profits and proceeds of which are placed to
the Borough Fund, under the act, and are applied towards the
reduction of the rates levied on the citizens.&nbsp; Several
large estates which were in the hands of the corporation for
charitable purposes are now vested in charity trustees.&nbsp; The
corporation still pay fee farm rents to the crown, over
&pound;100 yearly.&nbsp; There is in trust of the corporation an
estate of 112 acres, situated outside of St. <a
name="page446"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
446</span>Stephen&rsquo;s Gate, called the &ldquo;Town
Close,&rdquo; on which the burgesses had the right of commonage
formerly, but in lieu of which right the freemen receive a few
shillings yearly.&nbsp; The meetings of the corporation are held
in the Council Chamber in the Guildhall almost every fortnight
for the despatch of business, and meetings of the committees are
held almost daily.&nbsp; The body corporate, as a Council and
Board of Health, levies rates as we have already said to the
amount of &pound;45,000 yearly.&nbsp; The Board of Guardians sits
in the same room, and raises by poor rates about &pound;30,000
yearly, making the local taxation amount to &pound;75,000 per
annum.&nbsp; The City Police and Fire Brigade, under direction of
Mr. R. Hitchman, the chief constable, occupy the basement of the
Guildhall.&nbsp; The force, comprising nearly a hundred men, is
considered to be very efficient.</p>
<p>This year an extensive scheme was begun for an effective
drainage of the city.&nbsp; We subjoin a brief history of the
proceedings which led to this movement, and take the opportunity
at the same time of giving some details as to the general
operations of the Local Board of Health.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The New Drainage Scheme</span>.</h4>
<p>So long ago as 1862, complaints were made of the impurity of
the river in consequence of all the sewage of the city and of all
the water closets being poured into the stream.&nbsp; In 1863,
many inhabitants of Thorpe became urgent in their demands that
some immediate <a name="page447"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
447</span>steps should be taken to divert the sewage from the
river, but this was more easily asked than done.&nbsp; The Board
of Health, however, requested their then surveyor (Mr. Barry) to
report on the subject; and subsequently Mr. Bazalgette visited
Norwich and surveyed the stream.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1865 Mr. Bazalgette&rsquo;s report was
received.&nbsp; It recommended a plan of conveying the sewage
through main drains to Crown Point to irrigate the land
there.&nbsp; The board discussed the report and appointed a
sewerage committee, who entered into negotiations with R. J. H.
Harvey, Esq., M.P., for irrigating part of his estate at Crown
Point.&nbsp; Mr. Harvey was to pay the cost of preparing the land
for irrigation, and the annual cost of pumping; but after a
preliminary notice had been given of the intention of the board
to apply for an act of parliament, the board determined not to
proceed at that time with the application for the act.</p>
<p>The board subsequently entered into contract with Mr. Hope, of
London, to sell him the sewage for thirty years; and the
necessary works were ordered to be commenced on March 20th,
1866.&nbsp; The board, however, being pressed by a strong
opposition to the scheme, in a few days afterwards rescinded the
contract.&nbsp; In consequence of this, proceedings in chancery
were commenced, and an injunction was ultimately obtained.</p>
<p>On May 31st, 1866, the board resolved, &ldquo;That it is
absolutely needful at once to take measures to divert the sewage
from the river.&rdquo;&nbsp; Negotiations were <a
name="page448"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 448</span>entered
into for the hire of part of the Crown Point estate, the
agreement for which was confirmed by the board on July 10th,
1866.&nbsp; By this agreement the board took on lease 1290 acres
of land at Crown Point, at &pound;3 5s. per acre, for thirty
years&mdash;the whole sewage of the city to be conveyed to Trowse
and pumped over the land.&nbsp; Many objections were made to this
measure, that the rent was too high, and that the experiment
would prove a failure.&nbsp; Pursuant, however, to a resolution
of the board, passed on October 9th, in the same year, the
committee took the necessary steps to obtain an act of
parliament, and did obtain it in June, 1867.</p>
<p>After the act was obtained, Mr. Morant, the city engineer, by
direction of the committee, proceeded with the preparation of the
necessary drawings and specifications for the drainage works, and
by order of the board the following contracts were entered into,
namely:&mdash;</p>

sums are required for constructing drains, sewers, penstock
chamber, and other subsidiary works, and the entire scheme is
proposed to be carried out under the sanction of the act of
Parliament, at the estimated cost of &pound;60,000.</p>
<p>A very powerful opposition was raised against the
scheme.&nbsp; A memorial, very numerously signed, was presented
to the board of health against it.&nbsp; Public meetings were
held at which the whole thing was condemned as unnecessary,
expensive, and likely to be a failure.&nbsp; Eventually, after
much discussion, with a large minority against it, and in
opposition to the opinions of the citizens expressed in common
hall, the board resolved to carry out the scheme, and the works
are now in progress.&nbsp; The general plan is to construct two
main drains, one on each side of the river Wensum, to intercept
the sewage and to carry it to Trowse, where a pumping station has
been erected, and engines will be set to work to pump all the
sewage over the land hired at Crown Point estate.</p>
<p>The drainage expenditure, though so enormous, has been only a
part of the expenditure of the board, upon which the duty falls
of repairing all the streets and roads, lighting, watering,

expenditure was as follows:&mdash;</p>

irrespective of the drainage works.</p>
<p>The annual abstract of the accounts of the board issued in
1867, shows the receipts and payments from September 1st, 1866,
to September 1st, 1867.&nbsp; The receipts amounted to

<p>The engineer&rsquo;s next report was for the year ending April
5th, 1868, and was divided into three heads.&nbsp; Repairs to
roads; repairs to paving; and repairs to sewers.&nbsp; First with
respect to roads.&nbsp; The cost of the macadamised roads had
been &pound;2329 12s. 7d., being an <a name="page451"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 451</span>increase of &pound;137 7s. 8d.&nbsp;
Some new roads had been taken by the board, and were repaired and
cleansed, and all the roads were stated to be in good
order.&nbsp; Second, with respect to paving.&nbsp; The
expenditure had been &pound;1088 8s. 10d., being an increase of
&pound;218 13s., but a part of the Market Place had been newly
paved with granite at a cost of &pound;216.&nbsp; Third, with
respect to the sewers.&nbsp; The cost of repairs, &amp;c., had
been &pound;546 5s. 5d., being a decrease of &pound;29 16s.
9d.</p>
<p>Since 1850 the annals of the city consist chiefly of
proceedings of the corporation as a council or Board of
Health.&nbsp; Meetings have been held almost every fortnight for
the transaction of public business, which has been largely
increased.&nbsp; The proceedings of one single year, even if
summarised, would fill a volume.&nbsp; The corporation has levied
rates to the amount of &pound;45,000 yearly! and the expenditure
has been of equal amount.&nbsp; This has been caused by many
public improvements, by widening old streets and opening new
ones, and by the extension of the area of the Cattle Market.</p>
<p>Mr. Morant gives the following account of the drainage
works:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The drainage of the city of Norwich flows
into the river at numerous places, as is commonly the case; it is
the object of the new works now in progress to intercept all the
old sewers, to prevent the sewage flowing into the river, and to
convey it to one point.&nbsp; For this purpose several deep
sewers are being constructed, varying in size from 18 inches in
diameter to 6 feet high by 4 feet wide, of oval shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point selected for the pumping station is between
<a name="page452"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 452</span>the
railway at Trowse Station and the river Yare; and a large piece
of garden ground has been purchased, and engine and boilerhouses,
workshops, &amp;c., have been erected.&nbsp; Adjoining the
engine-well are the grating tank and penstock chamber, and with
these the principal main sewer communicates.&nbsp; This sewer,
which is 6 ft by 4 ft., is intended to be carried under the
bottom of Bracondale, Carrow Hill, and along King Street to near
Messrs. Morgan&rsquo;s brewery, where it will receive the
high-level sewer.&nbsp; This sewer will be from 30 ft. to 80 ft.
below the surface of the ground.&nbsp; From this point it will be
5 ft. 3 in. by 3 ft. 6 in., and will be continued along King
Street to the top of Rose Lane; here one branch will turn off to
the right under Rose Lane, beneath the bottom of the river near
Foundry Bridge, under the towing path, to beyond Bishopgate
Bridge, where it will unite with the present outfall sewer, and
receive the whole of the drainage of the northern portion of the
city.&nbsp; From Rose Lane the main will continue to Tombland,
where a branch will extend to Bishopgate Bridge, with subsidiary
branches to Quay Side, &amp;c.; it will then turn to the left
under Prince&rsquo;s Street, St. Andrews Broad Street, Charing
Cross, and Lower Westwick Street, and will unite with the present
sewer emptying itself at the New Mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the end of the principal main near Messrs.
Morgan&rsquo;s in King Street the high-level sewer will commence
with a flight of granite steps, about 30 feet in height, and
continue 4 ft. 6 in. by 3 ft., gradually reducing, and carried
under King Street to Rose Lane, across the Bull Ring, where it
will be about 44 feet below the surface, under Opie Street,
Bedford Street, Pottergate Street, West Pottergate Street, Mill
Hill, Rose Valley, Mount Pleasant, Town Close Road to Ipswich
Road, and will provide for the sewage of a very large district
hitherto entirely undrained.</p>
<p><a name="page453"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
453</span>&ldquo;Self-acting Storm Overflows are provided at
several convenient points, and also numerous shafts for access
to, and ventilation of, the sewers.&nbsp; At the pumping station
at Trowse the sewage, after passing through gratings to prevent
sticks and other substances from choking the pump valves, will
pass into the engine-well, from whence it will be pumped through
cast-iron pipes 20 inches in diameter, laid under the Kirby Road
to near the cross road leading to the Bungay Road, and then be
led in a main conduit across the centre of the land hired by the
Board, and by means of small feeders to every part of the
farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The steam engines will be three in number, and of the
kind known as condensing rotative beam engines, with steam
cylinders of 35 in. diameter and 6 ft. stroke.&nbsp; Each engine
will be provided with a high lift pump connected with the pumping
main, and also with a low lift pump; the object of the low lift
pumps is to enable the rain water to be pumped into the overflow
sewer in time of heavy storms, when the sewage is so greatly
diluted as to be little more than soiled water; the first
scouring of the sewers will be pumped by the high lift pumps on
to the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four boilers, each 27 ft. 6 in. long and 7 ft.
diameter, with two flues, are provided to produce the steam
necessary for working the engines, and the chimney shaft to
remove the smoke is 140 feet in height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The foundation of the engine had to be carried down 29
feet below the surface, and much difficulty was found in getting
in the walls on account of the force of the springs, the bottom
being 22 feet below the water level in the adjoining river, and
from the same cause considerable difficulty is met with in
driving the tunnels for the sewers.&nbsp; In Trowse for example,
the soil proved to be running sand and mud, which was very
troublesome to overcome; the same soil <a
name="page454"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 454</span>exists
under Rose Lane, Foundry Bridge, and Bishopgate Street, but
nearly everywhere else the tunnels will be in the chalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irrigation by sewage is no doubt quite in its infancy,
but from the very satisfactory results arrived at at Barking,
Croydon, Norwood, Edinburgh, Banbury, Rugby, and other places,
there is good reason to hope that eventually the Board&rsquo;s
Sewage Farm at Crown Point will prove a success.&rdquo;</p>

455</span>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
Norwich Musical Festivals.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the year 1824, musical
festivals have been held in this city triennially, for the
benefit, originally, of the hospitals, and lately of various
other charities also, and for the promotion of musical
science.&nbsp; These celebrations have been so successful on the
whole that the total surplus receipts over the expenditure have
amounted to more than &pound;10,000.&nbsp; Works of the greatest
composers have been well performed by the most eminent
instrumentalists and vocalists of the day, and thereby a taste
for music has been diffused throughout the city and county.</p>
<p>The patrons of the festivals have included the Queen, the late
Prince Consort, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duchess of
Kent, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duke of Cambridge, the
Princess Mary of Cambridge, the Duke of Wellington, the Marquis
of Lothian, the Earl of Roseberry, the Earl of Gosford, the Earl
of Orford, Lord W. Powlett, Lord Stanley, Lord Walsingham, Lord
Wodehouse, and many others of the nobility.&nbsp; The committee
of <a name="page456"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
456</span>management have included the Lord Lieutenant of the
county, the Earl of Albemarle, Lord Ranelagh, Lord Sondes, Lord
Hastings, Lord Stafford, Lord Suffield, Lord Bayning, Hon. W. C.
W. Coke, Hon. H. Walpole, Hon. W. Jerningham, Sir J. P. Boileau,
Bart., Sir W. Foster, Bart., Sir S. Bignold, and others.</p>
<p>The first musical performance for charitable purposes is said
to have been on the anniversary of the Sons of the Clergy, in
1709; some fifteen years after which period, the meeting of the
three choirs of Gloucester, Hereford, and Worcester, was
instituted, those cathedral cities sending their choristers to
each place in alternate years.&nbsp; These early music meetings,
however, were held in the evening, and seem to have been limited
to the performance of Anthems and the Te Deum.&nbsp; The first
occasion of an Oratorio having been performed in the morning
appears to have been at Hereford in 1759, when the Messiah was
given.</p>
<p>The Birmingham Triennial Festival was instituted about the
year 1778, and that of Norwich, as now held in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall, in 1824, previously to which the Norwich festival consisted
of the yearly performance of an Oratorio in the cathedral for the
benefit of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.&nbsp; The
performances of later years have been on a much grander
scale.&nbsp; The festivals at Birmingham and Norwich now stand
pre-eminent among provincial musical meetings, both for the
excellence of the performances, and for the special interest
given to the programmes by the first production of new or
little-known works.&nbsp; Among other claims to honourable <a
name="page457"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 457</span>distinction
in this respect, it is the chief and will be the lasting honour
to Norwich that Dr. Spohr&rsquo;s sacred Oratorios were first
performed here, his earliest production being conducted by
himself in person before a large audience.</p>
<p>The selection of works and music to be performed has always
occupied a great deal of the time and attention of the
committees, who have made it an object to bring out some new work
at every festival.&nbsp; Most of Handel&rsquo;s best Oratorios
have also been performed, including, of course, the
&ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; which is never omitted from the
programme.&nbsp; Haydn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Seasons&rdquo; have also been frequently given, while Dr.
Spohr&rsquo;s &ldquo;Calvary,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fall of
Babylon,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Last Judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr.
Bexfield&rsquo;s &ldquo;Israel Restored,&rdquo; Pierson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; and Molique&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Abraham&rdquo; were first performed in this city.&nbsp;
The programmes have also included Sterndale Bennett&rsquo;s
&ldquo;May Queen,&rdquo; which won all hearts; Benedict&rsquo;s
brilliant &ldquo;Undine,&rdquo; and many other approved
compositions.</p>
<p>The committees, acting on the principle of securing the
highest talent, have generally engaged the best vocal performers
whose services were available.&nbsp; In proof of this we need
only mention the names of the following female
vocalists:&mdash;Madame Viardot Garcia, Madame Caradori Allan,
Madame Clara Novello, Madame Sainton-Dolby, Madame Alboni, Madame
Malibran, Madlle. Tietjens, Madame Patti, Madame
Lemmens-Sherrington, Madame Rudersdorf, Miss Louisa Pyne, Madame
Grisi; and among the male <a name="page458"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 458</span>vocal performers may be mentioned
Signor Lablache, Herr Formes, Mr. Weiss, Signor Rubini, Signor
Belletti, Signor Morini, Mr. Santley, Mr. Sims Reeves, Mr.
Cummings, Signor Gassier, Signor Giuglini, Signor Mario, Mr.
Phillips, Mr. Lockey, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>The Norwich Choral Society, comprising 300 members having good
voices, altos, tenors, and basses, has contributed greatly to the
success of the festivals by the excellence of the choral
performances, especially in grand Oratorios.&nbsp; The Choral
Society was established in 1824, and had its origin in the
establishment of the musical festivals, Professor Taylor being
its chief promoter.&nbsp; In 1825 the Professor removed to
London, and the direction of the society was confided to the Rev.
R. F. Elwin.&nbsp; The management of affairs was entrusted to a
committee of twelve, who were annually elected by ballot at a
general meeting.&nbsp; The practice was held in the Old Library
Room or in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; The society has
undergone many changes, but has always maintained its high
reputation for choral performances.&nbsp; A memoir of the late
Professor Taylor, which appeared in the <i>Norfolk News</i>,
contained some information as to the part he took in promoting
the festivals.&nbsp; We give the following extracts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We learn from the <i>Quarterly Musical
Review</i>, which was edited by the late Mr. R. M. Bacon, that at
the Festival of 1824, &lsquo;Mr. Bacon, Mr. Taylor (late
Professor Taylor), and Mr. Athow, were nominated as a committee
for the entire conduct of the musical department.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Vol. VI. p. 434.&nbsp; The same authority says a little further
on, &lsquo;Mr. Taylor undertook <a name="page459"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 459</span>the formation of a Choral Society,
which he accomplished with a degree of knowledge, skill, and
perseverance, that cannot be too highly praised.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Again &lsquo;The musical committee then decided on the following
vocalists and instrumentalists, &amp;c.&rsquo;&nbsp; From all
which it seems that the triumvirate managed the musical
department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fitch once wrote to Mr. E. Taylor requesting him to
state what share he had in the management of the first
festival.&nbsp; The following was Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s reply, dated
March 25th, 1847.&nbsp; &lsquo;When the Norwich Festival was
resolved on in 1823, I made the entire selection (morning and
evening).&nbsp; I engaged every performer; I selected the entire
band, and I formed and trained the Choral Society.&nbsp; I have
done the same for every subsequent festival (until the last,
1845,) with the exception of having nothing to do with the Choral
Society, or any of the country performers.&nbsp; Every Oratorio
brought out (and a new one was always brought out) was translated
and prepared for performance by me.&rsquo;&nbsp; These were the
following performed for the first time here.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
Last Judgment,&rsquo; Spohr; &lsquo;The Crucifixion,&rsquo;
Spohr; &lsquo;The Fall of Babylon,&rsquo; Spohr; &lsquo;The
Deluge,&rsquo; Schneider; &lsquo;Redemption,&rsquo; Mozart;
&lsquo;The Death of Christ,&rsquo; Graun; &lsquo;The
Christian&rsquo;s Prayer,&rsquo; Spohr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be seen by the above how little Mr. E. Taylor
left for anybody else to do.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s two
associates, like the wings on a stage sylph, were more for
ornament than use.&nbsp; His statement is confirmed by the
<i>Musical Review</i>, which says, &lsquo;The Hospital Board
presented to Mr. Taylor a piece of plate, of fifty guineas value,
for his services in raising and instructing the Choral Society,
and for his general assistance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The memoir before mentioned further states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page460"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
460</span>&ldquo;At the Norwich Festival of 1830, Mr. Taylor
introduced Spohr&rsquo;s Oratorio of &lsquo;The Last
Judgment&rsquo; for the first time into this country, the words
being translated and adapted to the music by Mr. Taylor
himself.&nbsp; This was followed at subsequent festivals by other
oratorios of the same composer, which for originality, richness,
and beauty, are unrivalled in their way.&nbsp; After the
performance of &lsquo;The Last Judgment,&rsquo; Mr. Taylor became
personally acquainted with Spohr, and one day, getting an
invitation from Mendelssohn to visit him and his family at
Dusseldorf on the Rhine, where Spohr then was, the invitation was
accepted, and thus Mr. Taylor first became known to the
illustrious composer, with whom he formed a friendship which
lasted as long as they both lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Norwich Festival of 1836, the expenses exceeded
the receipts by &pound;231 5s. 10d.&nbsp; We give an extract from
a letter, written in the following year by Mr. Taylor to Mr.
Henry Browne, which will be read with pain, because it shows that
Mr. Taylor received far other treatment than he deserved at the
hands of the committee of management.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor said,
&lsquo;I hear of the discord engendered by the winding up of the
Festival with much concern, and which seems to threaten the
existence of future ones.&nbsp; How it happened that the last
terminated so unprofitably has always been a mystery to me.&nbsp;
I think it ought not.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Mr. Taylor goes on to state the amount of work which he
himself did for nothing.</p>
<p>All the festivals had been hitherto successful.&nbsp; The
first, in 1824, produced a surplus of &pound;2399 to the Norfolk
and Norwich Hospital.&nbsp; The second, in 1827, afforded that
institution &pound;1672; the third, in 1830, yielded &pound;535
to the hospital; the fourth, in 1833, was <a
name="page461"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 461</span>also
successful; but in 1836 the expenses of the Festival, as has been
shown, exceeded the receipts by &pound;231, and a general board
of the hospital resolved that no part of the funds belonging to
the institution should be used for any purpose connected with the
Festival.</p>
<p>At the Sixth Musical Festival, held on the 17th, 18th, 19th,
and 20th September, 1839, Dr. Spohr conducted his own new
Oratorio of &ldquo;Calvary,&rdquo; before a very large audience,
in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; The performance was very grand,
and produced a thrilling effect on the audience.&nbsp; The
selection of such a subject as the Crucifixion for an Oratorio
drew forth a good deal of criticism, but there could be no doubt
of the musical merits of the composition.</p>
<p>After the performance of &ldquo;The Crucifixion,&rdquo; Spohr
and Mr. Taylor were travelling outside the coach to London, when
the former expressed a wish to write another oratorio for
Norwich, but said that he was at a loss for a subject.&nbsp; Mr.
Taylor then suggested The Fall of Babylon.&nbsp; This led to a
chat about the effects which might be introduced in the way of
contrast, &amp;c., and ultimately Spohr promised to write the
oratorio if Taylor on his part would write the words.&nbsp; The
bargain was struck, and the result was a work which will live to
the end of time.</p>
<p>The Festival of 1842 was by far the most brilliant that had
been held.&nbsp; Of course Dr. Spohr&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fall of
Babylon&rdquo; was the chief attraction.&nbsp; It was performed
in the presence of the largest and most fashionable audience ever
seen in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; Numbers <a
name="page462"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 462</span>of the
gentry could not obtain admission.&nbsp; People stood under the
long galleries, and along the passages, and in every corner of
the building.&nbsp; The performance was a splendid success, and
greatly added to the fame of the composer.&nbsp; Professor Taylor
translated the Libretto, and was the conductor of the
Oratorio.&nbsp; On the following day he conducted the performance
of Handel&rsquo;s Oratorio of &ldquo;Samson,&rdquo; to which he
added selections from Handel&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; This caused a
good deal of adverse criticism, but it was not without
precedent.&nbsp; On Friday morning the Professor conducted a
performance of Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Messiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Festival of 1845 commenced on Tuesday evening, September
16th, and continued on the 17th, 18th, and 19th.&nbsp; The
programme included miscellaneous concerts on Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday evenings; a selection of sacred music, and
Haydn&rsquo;s Oratorio &ldquo;The Seasons,&rdquo; on Wednesday
morning; another selection of sacred music, and Spohr&rsquo;s
Oratorio &ldquo;Calvary,&rdquo; on Thursday morning; and
Handel&rsquo;s sacred Oratorio &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; with
additional accompaniments by Mozart, on Friday morning.&nbsp; All
the concerts were well attended.&nbsp; The principal vocalists
were Madame Grisi, Miss Dolby, Madame Caradori Allan, Miss Poole,
Signor Mario, Signor F. Lablache, Mr. Hobbs, Mr. Machin, Mr.
Hawkins, Mr. Bradbury, and Herr Staudigl.&nbsp; Mr. Benedict was
conductor; Mr. J. Hill, chorus master; Mr. F. Cooke, leader of
the band; Mr. Turle, organist.&nbsp; The chorus comprised the
usual number of voices.&nbsp; The band included the best
instrumentalists in England, and the festival was very
successful.</p>
<p><a name="page463"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 463</span>The
Festival of 1848 commenced on Tuesday, September 12th, with a
miscellaneous concert, followed by similar concerts on Wednesday
and Thursday evenings.&nbsp; On Wednesday morning the programme
comprised a sacred Cantata, by L. Spohr, &ldquo;The
Christian&rsquo;s Prayer,&rdquo; and Haydn&rsquo;s Oratorio
&ldquo;Creation.&rdquo;&nbsp; On Thursday morning
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Oratorio of &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; was
performed.&nbsp; On Friday morning &ldquo;David Penitent,&rdquo;
a sacred Cantata by Mozart, was given, followed by Handel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Israel in Egypt,&rdquo; one of the best of his numerous
productions.&nbsp; The principal vocalists were Madame Castellan,
Madame Alboni, Madame Viardot Garcia, Miss A. Williams, Miss M.
Williams; Signor Lablache, basso; Mr. Sims Reeves, tenor; Mr. H.
Phillips, basso; Mr. Whitworth, tenor; Mr. Lockey, tenor.&nbsp;
Mr. Benedict was conductor; Mr. H. Blagrove, leader of the band;
Mr. Harcourt, organist.&nbsp; Professor Taylor translated
&ldquo;The Christian&rsquo;s Prayer&rdquo; for this
occasion.&nbsp; Mr. J. F. Hill was chorus master.</p>
<p>In September, 1852, the Festival again comprised grand
miscellaneous concerts on the Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
evenings, which concerts were well attended.&nbsp; On the first
evening, Mrs. Fanny Kemble read the &ldquo;Midsummer&rsquo;s
Night&rsquo;s Dream,&rdquo; but the reading was a failure, as she
could only be heard a short distance from the orchestra.&nbsp; On
the Wednesday morning a new Oratorio, &ldquo;Israel
Restored,&rdquo; by Dr. Bexfield, was performed for the first
time at a festival.&nbsp; On Thursday morning Mr. H. H.
Pierson&rsquo;s Oratorio, &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; was performed
for the first time, and <a name="page464"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 464</span>occupied nearly four hours.&nbsp; On
Friday morning the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; was performed as
usual.&nbsp; The principal vocalists were Miss Louisa Pyne, Miss
Alleyne, Miss Dolby, Madame Viardot Garcia, Madame Fiorentini,
Signor Gardoni, Signor Belletti, Mr. Weiss, Mr. Lockey, Herr
Formes, Mr. Sims Reeves.&nbsp; Mr. Benedict was conductor; Mr. H.
Blagrove, leader of the band in the morning performances, and
Mons. Sainton in the evening performances; Mr. J. F. Hill, chorus
master.&nbsp; At the close of the performance on the Wednesday
morning (September 22nd), a short selection from Handel&rsquo;s
Oratorio of &ldquo;Samson&rdquo; was given as a tribute of
respect to the memory of the late Duke of Wellington.&nbsp;
Madame V. Garcia sung the solo&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ye sons of Israel, now lament,<br />
Your spear is broke, your bow unbent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your glory&rsquo;s fled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the dead,<br />
Our hero lies,<br />
For ever closed his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Dead March&rdquo; was played and the chorus
sung&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Glorious hero, may thy grave<br />
Peace and honour ever have;<br />
After all thy pains and woes,<br />
Rest eternal, sweet repose.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Festival in September, 1854, again comprised miscellaneous
concerts in the evenings, and Oratorios in the mornings.&nbsp; On
Tuesday morning, September 12th, the programme included
Rossini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stabat Mater,&rdquo; Meyerbeer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;91st Psalm,&rdquo; and a selection of sacred music.&nbsp;
On Wednesday morning Beethoven&rsquo;s <a
name="page465"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 465</span>Service in
C, and Haydn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; were brilliantly
performed.&nbsp; On Thursday morning Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; attracted a very large audience.&nbsp; On
Friday morning the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; was given, with the
additional accompaniments by Mozart.&nbsp; The principal
vocalists were Madame Clara Novello, Madame Angelina Bosio,
Madame Castellan, Madame Weiss, Miss Dolby, Mr. Sims Reeves,
Signor Gardoni, Herr Reichardt, Signor Lablache, Signor Belletti,
and Mr. Weiss.&nbsp; Mr. Benedict was conductor; Mons. Sainton
and Mr. H. Blagrove, instrumental solo performers; Herr Hausman,
violoncello; Mr. J. F. Hill, chorus master.&nbsp; On Tuesday
evening the concert included a descriptive and characteristic
Cantata, called &ldquo;Tam o&rsquo; Shanter,&rdquo; the words by
Burns and the music by Macfarren.&nbsp; It consisted of a solo
and chorus, which were sung with great applause.&nbsp; Indeed,
nothing so comic and lively had ever been heard before at any
festival.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all the attractions of this festival it proved
a failure in a financial point of view, and it was feared that
these triennial musical meetings would no longer answer, but
their promoters determined not to give them up.&nbsp; A committee
was appointed; efforts were made to secure by all proper means
success in future; and several of the county nobility joined as
members of the committee.&nbsp; That this determination was made
on good grounds, was fully proved by the success of the three
subsequent festivals of 1857, 1860, and 1863, the surplus from
which was, in round numbers, severally, &pound;425, &pound;916,
and &pound;1221.&nbsp; From these sums no less than &pound;2000
were distributed amongst the charities.</p>
<p><a name="page466"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 466</span>The
Festival of 1857 commenced on Tuesday evening, September 15th,
with a miscellaneous concert, and similar concerts were given on
Wednesday and Thursday evenings.&nbsp; On Wednesday morning the
programme comprised a sacred Cantata by Louis Spohr, &ldquo;God
Thou art Great,&rdquo; a Hymn of Praise (Lobgesang) by
Mendelssohn, and the &ldquo;Requiem&rdquo; of Mozart, his latest
work.&nbsp; On Thursday morning Beethoven&rsquo;s Sacred Cantata,
&ldquo;The Mount of Olives,&rdquo; and Haydn&rsquo;s Oratorio,
&ldquo;The Seasons&rdquo; were performed.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; was given on Friday morning, and concluded
the festival.&nbsp; The principal vocalists were Madame Clara
Novello, Madlle. Leonhardi, Madame Weiss, Mrs. Lockey, Madlle.
Piccolomini, Signor Gardoni, Signor Giuglini, Signor Belletti,
Mr. Lockey, Mr. Miranda, and Mr. Weiss.&nbsp; Mr. Benedict was
conductor; Mons. Sainton, H. Blagrove, and Herr Hausman, were
instrumental solo performers; Mr. J. F. Hill was chorus
master.</p>
<p>The Festival of 1860 was under very distinguished patronage
and eminently successful.&nbsp; The programme included
Haydn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Creation,&rdquo; Handel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; Dr. Spohr&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last
Judgment,&rdquo; Herr Molique&rsquo;s &ldquo;Abraham,&rdquo; and
Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dettingen Te Deum,&rdquo; all sacred music
of the highest class, assigned to the morning performances.&nbsp;
The evening concerts comprised Gl&uuml;ck&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Armida,&rdquo; Professor Sterndale Bennett&rsquo;s
Pastoral, &ldquo;The May Queen,&rdquo; Benedict&rsquo;s Cantata,
&ldquo;Undine,&rdquo; besides selections from the most popular
operas, part songs, madrigals, symphonies, and overtures, all of
which were admirably rendered and highly applauded.</p>
<p><a name="page467"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 467</span>The
choice of so large a work as Hadyn&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Creation,&rdquo; one of the finest of his productions, on
the first evening, was considered desirable, as it gave full
employment at once for the principal vocalists, the chorus, and
the band.&nbsp; As many persons could not attend in the morning,
an oratorio in the evening gave them an opportunity of hearing a
great work well performed, and the lovers of sacred music readily
seized the opportunity presented to them of attending the
performance, which was never more perfect.&nbsp; No band could
have possibly played it more exquisitely, no chorus could have
sung it more honestly or earnestly, and the solos were beyond all
praise.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning was assigned to performances of a sacred and
very solemn character; Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dettingen Te
Deum,&rdquo; and Spohr&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Handel composed five Te Deums, but the finest is that written in
1743, in celebration of the victory at Dettingen, then thought a
great event.&nbsp; The victory was rather unexpected, and as
George II. commanded in person, the rejoicings in England were
very general.&nbsp; Horace Walpole wrote, &ldquo;We are all mad;
drums, trumpets, bumpers, bonfires!&nbsp; The mob are wild, and
cry &lsquo;Long live King George and the Duke of
Cumberland!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; After the &ldquo;Te Deum,&rdquo;
there was a short interval preceding the performance of Dr.
Spohr&rsquo;s great work &ldquo;Die Letzten Dinge&rdquo; (The
Last Things), the earliest of the composer&rsquo;s three
oratorios.&nbsp; In 1825 it was brought over from Germany by
Professor Taylor, and it was first performed before an English
audience at the Norwich Festival on September 24th, <a
name="page468"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 468</span>1830, under
the title of &ldquo;The Last Judgment,&rdquo; which does not
convey a very correct idea of the work.&nbsp; It was received
with the greatest possible favour, like all other works of the
same master, in this city.&nbsp; The grand theme is set forth in
a series of paraphrases of scripture texts referring to the final
consummation of all things.</p>
<p>The novelties at this festival were Professor Sterndale
Bennett&rsquo;s Pastoral &ldquo;The May Queen,&rdquo; and
Benedict&rsquo;s brilliant Cantata, &ldquo;Undine,&rdquo; both of
which were performed with great success.&nbsp; The Pastoral was
produced with complete success at the Leeds Musical Festival, in
September, 1858.&nbsp; Mr. Chorley composed the poem, and he
deserves some credit for the verses, as well as for the dramatic
character of the piece.&nbsp; The overture is a beautiful
composition, and the whole work displays a marvellous combination
of simplicity and ingenuity.&nbsp; Herr Molique&rsquo;s new
Oratorio, &ldquo;Abraham,&rdquo; was performed here for the first
time, and conducted by the composer, who at the close was greatly
applauded.&nbsp; The words are taken from the Old Testament, and
the characters personated are Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, Isaac,
Angel, and Messenger, who in turn depict the different scenes in
the life of the patriarch.&nbsp; He is exhibited as a saint, as a
warrior, and as a great sufferer.&nbsp; Full scope is given for
the display of human passion in almost every phase, from
triumphant joy to a sorrow that borders on despair.&nbsp; The
incidents are picturesque, striking, and varied, calling all the
powers of the orchestra into play.&nbsp; The principal vocalists
were Madame Clara Novello, (her <a name="page469"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 469</span>last appearance in Norwich,) Madame
Weiss, Miss Palmer, Madame Borghi Mamo, Madlle. Tietjens, Signor
Giuglini, Signor Belletti, Mr. Sims Reeves, Mr. Wilbye Cooper,
Mr. Santley, Mr. Weiss.&nbsp; Instrumental solo performers, Miss
Arabella Goddard, piano; Mr. Sainton, Mr. H. Blagrove, Signor
Piatti, violoncello; Mr. Benedict, conductor; Mr. J. F. Hill,
chorus master.</p>
<p>The Festival of 1863 commenced on Monday evening, September
14th, with a performance of Handel&rsquo;s grand Oratorio,
&ldquo;Judas Maccab&aelig;us,&rdquo; which was eminently
successful.&nbsp; The large audience seemed to be carried away by
the martial music.&nbsp; On the Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
evenings, miscellaneous concerts were given.&nbsp; On Wednesday
morning Mr. Silas conducted a performance of his own sacred
drama, &ldquo;Joash,&rdquo; with success.&nbsp; This was followed
by a &ldquo;Scene at the Gates of Nain,&rdquo; from the Oratorio
&ldquo;Immanuel,&rdquo; by Henry Leslie; also selections from the
Stabat Maters of Haydn, Pergolesi, and Rossini, and a selection
of sacred music.&nbsp; &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; was performed on
Thursday morning, and the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; on Friday
morning.&nbsp; Another novelty at this festival was a Cantata,
entitled &ldquo;Richard C&oelig;ur De Leon,&rdquo; composed
expressly for the occasion, and performed on Thursday evening
with immense applause.&nbsp; This Cantata embodied the romantic
story of the warrior king in captivity, being discovered by the
minstrel Blondel, who at last caused the liberation of the
monarch.&nbsp; The principal vocalists were Madlle. Tietjens,
Madame Lemmens Sherrington, Madame Weiss, Miss <a
name="page470"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 470</span>Wilkinson,
Miss Palmer, Madlle. Trebelli, (her first appearance in Norwich,)
Mr. Sims Reeves, Mr. Montem Smith, Mr. Santley, Mr. Weiss, Signor
Bettini, (his first appearance here,) Signor Bossi, (his first
appearance here).&nbsp; Mr. Benedict was conductor.&nbsp;
Instrumental soloists, M. Paque, violoncello; Mr. H. Blagrove and
Mr. Sainton, violins.&nbsp; Mr. J. F. Hill, chorus master.</p>
<p>The Festival of 1866 was deferred till November, very
unwisely, in anticipation of a visit of the Prince and Princess
of Wales on the occasion.&nbsp; This caused a larger attendance
on the day their Royal Highnesses were expected, and a smaller on
all the other days.&nbsp; The arrangements for the visit were
also injudicious, to say the least.&nbsp; Their Royal Highnesses
should at once have proceeded to the Wednesday morning&rsquo;s
performance, but they were detained at the Guildhall to hear an
address from the corporation, and then they were allowed to go to
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall in the middle of a performance, which was
greatly interrupted.&nbsp; Their Royal Highnesses, therefore,
could not possibly have appreciated Costa&rsquo;s Oratorio from
hearing only half of it.&nbsp; The festivals have been always
patronized by royalty, and by the nobility, gentry, and clergy,
and have never failed to attract the county families; but this
year (1866) was the first in which members of the royal family
were actually present.</p>
<p>The general programme for 1866 when issued, presented some
points of peculiar attraction, including &ldquo;Israel in
Egypt,&rdquo; by Handel, on Monday evening; an Anthem by Dr.
Spohr, and the Oratorio of <a name="page471"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 471</span>&ldquo;Naaman,&rdquo; by Costa, on
Wednesday morning; &ldquo;St. Cecilia,&rdquo; a new Cantata by
Benedict, selections from the Passion Music of Handel, and first
and second parts of the &ldquo;Creation,&rdquo; by Haydn, on
Thursday morning; and the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; on Friday
morning.&nbsp; Most lovers of sacred music would have preferred
Haydn&rsquo;s entire Oratorio to the sombre Passion Music.&nbsp;
The committee, acting on the principle of securing the highest
talent, made engagements with Madlle. Tietjens, Madame
Rudersdorff, Miss Edith Wynne, Madame De Meric Lablache, Madlle.
Anna Drasdil, three of them appearing for the first time in this
city; also with Mr. Sims Reeves, Mr. Cummings, Signor Morini, Mr.
Santley, Mr. Weiss, and Signor Gassier, all well-known
vocalists.&nbsp; The instrumentalists were all first-class
performers.&nbsp; The choral body was much improved and
strengthened, and included 62 of the best trebles ever selected,
24 contraltos, 35 altos, 59 tenors, and 67 basses.</p>
<p>Handel&rsquo;s Oratorio, &ldquo;Israel in Egypt,&rdquo; was
splendidly performed on the Monday evening; the solos were in the
hands of first-class vocalists, but the absence of Mr. Sims
Reeves was a disappointment.&nbsp; Mr. George Macfarren had
improved the instrumentation by the addition of parts to the
original score.&nbsp; He had no occasion to apologize for doing
for &ldquo;Israel,&rdquo; what many musicians have done for other
productions.&nbsp; It is not presumptuous to have recourse to the
resources of more modern instrumentation, so long as the
character of the work is not altered.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, as we have said, the <a
name="page472"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 472</span>Prince and
Princess of Wales were present.&nbsp; The performances commenced
with Dr. Spohr&rsquo;s Anthem &ldquo;O blessed, for ever blessed,
are they,&rdquo; the first time of performance, and it was
admirably rendered.&nbsp; Mr. Costa then conducted a splendid
performance of his own Oratorio of &ldquo;Naaman,&rdquo; founded
on a part of Old Testament history, relating to the restoration
from death of the son of the Shunamite by the prophet Elisha; a
subject not very well adapted for musical purposes.&nbsp; All
Oratorios are cast more or less in the Handelian mould, but Mr.
Costa has introduced more of the secular clement than usual.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning the hall was well filled by a large
audience desirous of hearing a performance of Handel&rsquo;s
Passion Music, and Mr. Benedict&rsquo;s new work, &ldquo;St.
Cecilia.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to the former, we may state that there
are two works of Handel entitled &ldquo;Passion Music,&rdquo; one
produced, it is believed, in 1704, the other in 1716.&nbsp; Dr.
Chrysander caused the publication of both these works by the
Leipzig Handel Society in 1860 and 1863.&nbsp; It is strange that
these two productions should have slumbered so long unheard and
unknown till the selection was performed in Norwich.&nbsp;
Interesting as the Passion Music might be, the all-important
event of this morning&rsquo;s concert was, the production of Mr.
Benedict&rsquo;s new Cantata.&nbsp; &ldquo;St. Cecilia&rdquo; has
long been a favourite subject with both poets and
composers.&nbsp; Among the former, Fletcher, Dryden, Pope,
Addison, Congreve, and a host of versifiers, have contributed
Odes in honour of the patroness of music.&nbsp; Many of these
Odes are still in existence, <a name="page473"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 473</span>with their accompanying music, of
various degrees of merit; the principal being those by Purcell
and Handel.&nbsp; These are great names, but the construction of
the older works is entirely different from the Cantata now
performed for the first time with great applause.&nbsp; After a
short interval the concert was continued with the
&ldquo;Creation,&rdquo; which could not have been better
performed or with a stronger cast.</p>
<p>Friday morning has been always assigned to the performance of
the &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; and to hear it every seat in the hall
was this time occupied, and numbers could not obtain
admission.&nbsp; We have heard this sublime Oratorio scores of
times, in London and in many large towns, and here at every
festival since 1840, but we never heard it rendered with greater
effect than the last time (in 1866).</p>
<p>Norwich has in many ways obtained credit and advantage from
the Musical Festivals.&nbsp; Their high character has placed the
city in a very eminent position in the musical world, and many of
the citizens cherish a just pride in endeavouring to qualify
themselves for the maintenance of that degree of excellence which
the festivals enable them to exhibit in the choral performances,
which the best judges have pronounced second to none in the
kingdom.&nbsp; On the whole the festivals have contributed
largely to the funds of important charities, and will no doubt
continue to do so if conducted with judgment and economy.&nbsp;
They have always attracted large numbers of visitors to the old
city, for the same facilities which make it easy for <i>us</i> to
go elsewhere to hear good music, enable <a
name="page474"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 474</span>others to
come hither for the same purpose.&nbsp; Many persons will always
come from distant places to hear a well-trained Norwich
chorus.&nbsp; And besides all this, not the least of the benefits
derived from these triennial meetings, is that they encourage an
interchange of good feeling and hospitality between the city and
county, and afford to those who enjoy music such an amount of
pleasure as must contribute, at least for a time, to cheerfulness
and happiness in their social intercourse with their fellow
creatures.</p>

475</span>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
Eminent Citizens of the Nineteenth Century.</h3>
<h4><i>Professor Taylor</i>.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Professor Taylor</span> claims the first
place in our notices of the eminent citizens of this period, as a
politician, a musician, and a public man.&nbsp; After his death a
memoir of him appeared in the <i>Norfolk News</i> of March 28th,
and April 4th, 1863, and from it we derive the following
details:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Edward Taylor was the great grandson of
the celebrated Dr. John Taylor, a man not less beloved for the
kindliness of his disposition, than he was venerated for his vast
learning.&nbsp; Dr. Taylor was born at Lancaster in the year
1694, and came to Norwich (according to Mr. Edward Taylor&rsquo;s
account) in 1733.&nbsp; Here he remained till 1757, and here it
was that he produced many of his works, amongst others his famous
Hebrew Concordance, which was published in two large volumes,
folio, and was the labour of fourteen years.&nbsp; Many copies of
the frontispiece (a fine portrait engraved by Houbraken) are
still extant in this city.&nbsp; Dr. Taylor must have been fond
of music, and must also have made it a personal study.&nbsp; This
we infer, less from his <a name="page476"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 476</span>having published &lsquo;A Collection
of Tunes in Various Airs&rsquo; for the use of his Norwich
congregation, than from his having been able to Prefix thereto
&lsquo;Instructions in the Art of Psalmody.&rsquo;&nbsp; The airs
themselves have no other accompaniment added than an unfigured
bass, but the collection contains many of the finest melodies
which are now in use.&nbsp; The instructions were intended to
enable a student to sing at sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Dr. Taylor quitted Norwich, his only surviving
son, Richard, remained, and carried on the business of a
manufacturer in St. George Colegate.&nbsp; Mr. John Taylor,
father of the subject of this memoir, was born the 30th July,
1750.&nbsp; In 1773, he entered into the business of a yarn
maker, in partnership with his brother, in the parish where their
father had lived.&nbsp; If not a musical composer, John had the
reputation of being at least a tolerable poet, and he was
peculiarly happy in writing words for music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In April, 1777, Mr. John Taylor married Susannah, the
youngest daughter of Mr. John Cook of Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. Edward
Taylor was born on the 22nd of January, 1784, in the parish of
St. George Colegate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his boyish days, Edward Taylor was made to imbibe
the usual quantity of Greek and Latin, and the cask ever after
retained the flavour of the wine.&nbsp; But music even then was
his chief delight.&nbsp; When arrived at manhood he was tall and
well formed; he had a fair, though by no means a pallid
complexion, a penetrating eye, and a majestic voice, which
sounded in conversation like the roll of a bass drum.&nbsp; In
whatever part of the world he had been met, it would have been
said at a glance, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s an Englishman.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He had that unmistakeable stamp of bluntness and sturdy
independence which seems to be an Englishman&rsquo;s
birthright.&nbsp; He was proud, not altogether without reason, of
his <a name="page477"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
477</span>ancestors, whose religious and political opinions he
inherited.&nbsp; Hence, he was a Dissenter of the Unitarian
School, and what was then called a Radical Reformer.&nbsp;
Deeming himself to be in the right, he of course considered all
those who differed from him to be in the wrong.&nbsp; But being
himself consistent, he knew how to respect consistency in
others.&nbsp; His hostility was confined to men&rsquo;s doctrines
and measures; it was never extended to their persons.&nbsp; In a
word, he was generous, manly, and sincere, and he therefore
enjoyed the friendship of good and true men, whatever might be
their party or creed.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor married, in 1808, Deborah,
daughter of Mr. William Newson, of Stump Cross, in this city, a
man of upright and honourable character, and a successful
tradesman.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The memoir contains a sketch of Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s political
doings, which we shall give in another part of this work, and it
then proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On the 19th January, 1824, he had the
honour of dining with the Duke of Sussex, at Kensington
Palace.&nbsp; The next year, 1825, terminated Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s
residence in his native city, though to the end of his life he
continued to take a warm interest in whatever concerned its
welfare.&nbsp; On the 21st of May, having already made
arrangements for giving up his business in Norwich, he went up to
London to prepare for making it his future abode.&nbsp; On the
5th of August, he served on the Norwich grand jury for the last
time, and the next day took his final departure.&nbsp; On the
15th, he joined his brother Philip and his cousin John Martineau
in their business, as civil engineers, having hired a house for
that purpose in York Place, City Road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 3rd of January, 1826, the year after Mr. Taylor
finally left the city for London, he came down to a dinner <a
name="page478"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 478</span>which was
given at the Rampant Horse Hotel in his honour.&nbsp; The
original intention had been to place his portrait in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, and Sir James Smith had actually written
some lines to be placed under it, beginning&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Avaunt, ye base, approach ye wise and good,<br />
Thus in this hall once Edward Taylor stood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But that idea was abandoned, and a presentation of a service
of plate was determined upon by his fellow-citizens.&nbsp; The
proposition originated with the strongest of his political
antagonists in the Corporation.&nbsp; The plate was given at this
dinner at the Rampant Horse, the chairman being Henry Francis,
Esq., against whom Mr. Taylor had entered the lists in the
severest contest ever known in the Mancroft Ward.&nbsp; This
rendered the compliment greater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Edward Taylor&rsquo;s first music master was the
Rev. Charles Smyth, a man who was equally remarkable for his
eccentricity and musical learning.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor always spoke
with great respect of Mr. Smyth&rsquo;s musical knowledge.&nbsp;
How long the lessons continued we have no means of ascertaining,
but we afterwards find Taylor gaining instruction with the
Cathedral boys under Dr. Beckwith at the music room in the
Cathedral.&nbsp; He also had lessons in the vestry room of the
Octagon Chapel; and he acquired some skill upon the flute and
oboe from Mr. Fish.&nbsp; But we believe that his musical
education was throughout gratuitously bestowed, out of respect to
himself and his family.&nbsp; Doubtless he was greatly indebted
for his extensive knowledge of the art, as well as of the German
and Italian languages, to his own perseverance in solitary
study.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author of the memoir, after giving a sketch of the
&ldquo;Hall Concert&rdquo;, notices Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s labours on
behalf <a name="page479"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
479</span>of the Musical Festivals in this city, as already
related in our brief account of those celebrations.&nbsp; Mr.
Taylor was one of their chief promoters, and he worked hard to
make them successful.&nbsp; In reference to Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s
career in London, the author of the memoir says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It has been before stated that on the 15th
August, 1825, Mr. Taylor entered upon a new course of life, in
London, in connection with his brother Philip and Mr. John
Martineau, who were civil engineers.&nbsp; Had the business
proved lucrative, there is no reason to suppose that Mr. Taylor
would have left it.&nbsp; It is certain that when he went to live
in London, nothing was further from his thoughts than that he
would ever embrace music as a profession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Taylor began anew the battle of life by taking
private pupils.&nbsp; From the first moment of his entering the
musical profession, his classical attainments, his skill as a
translator, his superior mental powers, and his extensive musical
research, were honestly and fully recognized.&nbsp; On the 29th
March, 1827, Mr. Taylor made his first appearance before a London
audience as a public singer.&nbsp; His deb&ucirc;t was at Covent
Garden, at the Oratorios under the management of Sir H. R.
Bishop.&nbsp; The song he chose was &lsquo;The Battle of
Hohenlinden,&rsquo; composed by C. Smith, and the reception he
received from a very crowded audience was exceedingly
favourable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After quoting some very eulogistic notices of Mr.
Taylor&rsquo;s subsequent performances, the writer of the memoir
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In this year (1828) was published
&lsquo;Airs of the Rhine,&rsquo; accompaniments by William
Horsley, Mus. Bac., Oxon, the poetry translated by Edward
Taylor.&nbsp; Of Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s brief <a
name="page480"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 480</span>sketch of
German music prefixed to this collection, the <i>Quarterly
Musical Review</i> (conducted by Mr. R. M. Bacon) says, &lsquo;It
is so agreeably written, and contains so many authentic and
interesting particulars, that we must do him the justice to give
it a place at length.&nbsp; It will speak more for the
publication than anything we can say to interest the
reader.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1837, Mr. Taylor was elected Gresham Professor of
Music.&nbsp; The place had been for 200 years a mere sinecure,
generally held by persons totally ignorant of music, but he did
much to render it useful to the art.&nbsp; In 1838 he published
his &lsquo;Three Inaugural Lectures,&rsquo; which he dedicated to
the Trustees of Gresham College.&nbsp; He was not content with
reading his lectures, however good.&nbsp; He illustrated them by
having some compositions of the master who might be under
discussion, well sung in parts by a competent choir.&nbsp;
Amateurs of distinction and professional men lent their aid, and
this attracted large audiences to the theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1843, Professor Taylor, who had been musical critic
for the <i>Spectator</i> for fourteen years, retired from that
department, and he received a very complimentary letter from Mr.
Rintoul the editor, who said, &lsquo;I can bear my willing
testimony to the high aims, the great ability, the persevering
zeal, and undeviating punctuality with which you have upheld the
cause of good music in my journal for the long period of fourteen
years.&nbsp; I believe that a selection from your writings in the
<i>Spectator</i> would comprise a body of the soundest and best
musical criticism in the language; and when you retire, I know
not that any second man in England is qualified to sustain the
elevated standard that you have raised, &amp;c.&rsquo;&nbsp; High
praise indeed, but well deserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the year 1845, Professor Taylor published, in the
<i>British and Foreign Review</i>, an article headed &lsquo;The
English <a name="page481"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
481</span>Cathedral Service; its Glory, its Decline, and its
Designed Extinction.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was subsequently published
by permission of the proprietor in the form of a thin octavo
volume.&nbsp; It was a masterly defence of the musical services
of our Cathedrals, and of the choirs, against the spoliation of
the deans and chapters, which had been silently and surely going
on ever since the time of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; It made a strong
sensation at the time, and even now, whoever would strike a blow
for the cause of Cathedral music, (which in Professor
Taylor&rsquo;s opinion is the salt which can alone save the
musical taste of the people from corruption) will find the best
weapons ready to his hand contained in this little volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Taylor, who had been long a widower, died
(March 12th, 1863,) with the utmost tranquillity, at his house at
Brentwood.&nbsp; He had three children, all of whom survive him;
a son, Mr. John Edward Taylor, who was with him in his last
moments, and two daughters, one of whom is married and lives in
Germany, her sister living with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that Mr. Taylor left injunctions that his
manuscripts should not be published, which is surely to be
regretted.&nbsp; If his rare and valuable musical library, the
acquisition of which was the labour of a life, should be sold, we
trust that it will not go piecemeal to the hoards of individual
collectors, but be bought for the use of Gresham College and its
future musical professors.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The compiler of this history had some long interviews with
Professor Taylor when he last visited Norwich in 1857, and he
then stated that he had large collections of music, and a large
number of lectures on the music of every period.&nbsp; He
delivered a very splendid lecture on the music of the Elizabethan
<a name="page482"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 482</span>age, in
aid of the funds of the Free Library, before a large audience, in
the Lecture Hall, St. Andrew&rsquo;s.</p>
<h4><i>The Rev. Mark Wilks</i>.</h4>
<p>The Rev. Mark Wilks, who lived in the last, and in the early
part of the present century, was a very remarkable character as a
politician and a preacher.&nbsp; From his biography, written by
his daughter and published in 1821, we derive the following
particulars.&nbsp; He was the son of a subordinate officer in the
army, and was born at Gibraltar on February 5th, 1748.&nbsp; When
his father and family returned to England they lived at
Birmingham, where young Mark was brought up to a trade, and where
he became an itinerant Baptist preacher, without any
chapel.&nbsp; The Countess of Huntingdon heard of his exertions,
and invited him to her college at Trevecca, to which he removed
in 1775, and studied there for a year.&nbsp; In 1776 the Countess
appointed him to be minister of the Tabernacle in Norwich, which
became the scene of his most continued and concentrated
exertions.&nbsp; The first sermon he preached here was on a
Sunday evening to a crowded congregation, and he made a great
impression.&nbsp; He preached in the same pulpit that Whitfield
once occupied, and the simplicity of the new minister&rsquo;s
appearance, and the negligence of his exterior, surpassed that of
the apostle of Calvinism.&nbsp; His long hair fell carelessly
over his shoulders; his meagre person and ruddy countenance gave
him at mature age the aspect of youth.&nbsp; The whole of his <a
name="page483"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 483</span>demeanour
was illuminated by the fire of affectionate zeal, and by an
earnestness of manner, evincing that he was honest in the sacred
cause of truth.&nbsp; From this time he continued his ministry
till 1778, when in the spring of that year he married Susannah
Jackson of Norwich.&nbsp; This was an event which he ever justly
estimated as the happiest of his life, but it severed his
connexion with the patroness of the Tabernacle.&nbsp; Her rule
was to dismiss the students of her college on their
marriage.&nbsp; The Countess of Huntingdon regretted the
separation and recommended him to several destitute
congregations, none of which, however, were then suited to his
views.</p>
<p>After travelling about for some time in Wiltshire, where he
preached in several chapels, he returned to Norwich, and on
January 1st, 1780, his new meeting place was opened, and he
became a pastor under the denomination of Calvinistic Methodist,
without the customary form of ordination.&nbsp; During the
interval which elapsed between his return to Norwich and his
establishment as a Baptist minister, his congregation rapidly
increased, and continued to increase from 1780 till 1788.&nbsp;
He lived in retirement, and performed with satisfaction and
marked punctuality the duties of his ministry.&nbsp; His
congregation was formed into a regular Baptist church in May,
1788, and it remained so all his life.&nbsp; On this change many
of his former supporters left him, so that his income was
reduced.&nbsp; He therefore took a farm in the neighbourhood of
Norwich, and commenced farming on an extensive scale.&nbsp;
Employment or poverty was his only alternative, <a
name="page484"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 484</span>and he
followed the example of the apostle Paul by supporting
himself.</p>
<p>We now approach a period in his life in which he distinguished
himself not only as a pastor, but also as a citizen and patriot;
for in the year 1790 commenced those great events in France which
laid the foundation of the long war between this country and that
unfortunate empire, a war disastrous to both.&nbsp; On July 14th,
1791, Mr. Wilks preached two eloquent discourses to commemorate
the leading features of the first French Revolution, before
crowded congregations, composed of the most influential persons
in the city and its neighbourhood.&nbsp; The propriety of such
discourses from the pulpit may be doubted, but they caused great
excitement, as the preacher defended the revolution, which was
then viewed with terror by many people.&nbsp; We shall notice
this, however, more at length in the political part of our
narrative, in which we shall have to speak of the very active
part which Mr. Wilks took in political affairs both in the city
and county.&nbsp; That Mr. Wilks was a rather violent partisan,
and more of a Radical than a Whig, will appear by an extract from
his biography, respecting a county election.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the Honourable William Wyndham first
offered himself as a candidate for the county of Norfolk, he came
in the character of a Whig, and a professed friend of civil and
religious liberty.&nbsp; Mr. Wilks then warmly supported him, and
to his exertions Mr. Wyndham attributed his success.&nbsp; But
the revolution in France effected a strange change in the
principles of Mr. Wyndham; and on his second appearance <a
name="page485"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 485</span>as
candidate for Norfolk, he presented himself in the character of a
&lsquo;war minister,&rsquo; and the enthusiastic abettor of the
most disgraceful and perilous measures ever pursued by weak and
wicked men.&nbsp; Instead, therefore, of receiving support, he
met with the most determined opposition from those who had been
before his active friends.&nbsp; As Mr. Wilks on his former
election had supported him by the most vigorous exertions, he now
appeared foremost in the ranks of his opponents; and Mr. Wyndham
regarded him with fear and jealousy.&nbsp; The following anecdote
will show with what gratitude he returned the former services of
him whom he had called his friend.&nbsp; One morning, as a very
intimate friend of Mr. Wilks was passing by the house of a poor
man, he was unexpectedly invited in, and was informed by the man
that his wife had just found an open letter, the contents of
which were of the greatest importance to Mr. Wilks.&nbsp; It
indeed proved so.&nbsp; It was a letter from Mr. Wyndham to one
of his friends at Norwich, desiring him to be most vigilant in
watching the movements and expressions of Mr. Wilks; and if at
any time he uttered anything which might be made to appear
treasonable, to make him acquainted with it, assuring him that he
would take the most prompt and severe means for his
conviction.&nbsp; No sooner had Mr. Wilks read this letter than
he hastened with it to the printer&rsquo;s, and in a few hours
the perfidy of Mr. Wyndham was publicly known in every part of
the city, and the original letter returned to its proprietor, to
his inexpressible dismay and confusion.&nbsp; The family and
friends of Mr. Wilks regarded this circumstance as an
interposition of a watchful Providence.&nbsp; But for this
circumstance a few days might have seen him the inmate of a
dungeon, and his life devoted, through the incautiousness of a
sentence, to the treachery of an enemy.&nbsp; This supposition
may appear less improbable <a name="page486"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 486</span>when it is known, that at that time
some who had been less active and less violent than himself, had
been snatched from their families during the stillness of the
midnight hour, and had been conveyed to prison without any form
or reason assigned to them.&nbsp; This attempt upon the liberty,
and perhaps the life, of Mr. Wilks had the beneficial effect of
making him more vigilant over his words, and more cautious,
although not less bold and decisive in all his proceedings.&nbsp;
Yet his wife and friends entertained so great an anxiety for his
safety, that they strongly importuned him to seek an asylum under
the calmer skies of America, but he resisted their
importunities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be mentioned, as an instance of the generosity
of Mr. Wilks&rsquo; disposition, as well as a proof that his
political conduct originated in genuine principles of patriotism,
that when Mr. Wyndham again returned as a candidate for Norfolk
as conjoint supporter of the Whig interest in union with Mr.
Coke, Mr. Wilks never suffered the recollection of his private
wrongs to interfere with the principles that Mr. Wyndham had come
forward to maintain, but supported him with the same firmness and
ardour as he had ever done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is necessary to return to those incidents of his
life, the order of which has been neglected in pursuing the chain
of his political character, and which he considered of far
greater importance than any other.&nbsp; In the year 1792, the
Baptist Missionary Society was established by Carey, Fuller,
Pearce, and Ryland.&nbsp; Those incomparable men, in a small room
at Kettering, planted the germ of that tree which has since
spread its branches into the remotest corners of the earth.&nbsp;
The Indian Banyan is famed for its fertility; it is planted, it
grows, and its branches descending, strike root, and reproduce
another tree; its branches again descend, and produce another
tree; trees succeed in endless multiplication, till a <a
name="page487"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 487</span>far and
wide-spreading beauteous forest is formed from the vast trunk of
what was once a single plant.&nbsp; In India flourishes a moral
Banyan; it has been planted by the hand of a Carey, a Fuller, a
Pearce, a Ryland, and a Wilks; watered and cultivated by their
labours and their prayers, its roots have taken a deeper and
deeper root, and the day is approaching when the sultry clime of
India shall be covered by its shadows, cheered by its verdant
foliage, and refreshed by its heavenly fruits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well known that Mr. Wilks&rsquo; devotion to the
missionary cause was early and invincible.&nbsp; Whether he was
present at its establishment is rather doubtful; but from its
commencement he regarded it as the dawn of happiness to the
world, and put into action all his powers and his influence in
promoting so benevolent an end.&nbsp; But it was not in the
mission alone that he evinced his benevolence and his
disinterestedness.&nbsp; Nine years had elapsed since he first
commenced farming, and during that time and the succeeding year
he preached regularly, and fulfilled all the duties incumbent on
his station, without receiving for his services the smallest
remuneration.&nbsp; Whether in this instance he acted in all
respects with prudence has frequently been doubted by himself as
well as his friends.&nbsp; His conduct originated in feelings of
the purest benevolence, although perhaps it lost its excellence
in losing its justice.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the year 1797 Mr. Wilks was obliged to quit his farm, the
lease of which had expired.&nbsp; He immediately engaged another
at Aldborough, a village near Harleston in Suffolk, and went
there to reside with his family in March, 1797.&nbsp; The
distance of that place was seventeen miles from Norwich; yet
although he was necessarily obliged to omit the week-day <a
name="page488"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 488</span>preaching,
he never once neglected the regular performance of his pastoral
duties on Sunday.&nbsp; In every kind of weather he constantly
travelled thirty-four miles every Sunday to preach to a
congregation from whom he received no remuneration.&nbsp; This
course of exertion, however, could not be long continued.&nbsp;
With the engagements of his farm, which were at this time very
considerable, and the care attendant on a large family of twelve
children, he found it was necessary either to give up his church
or to leave his farm.&nbsp; Though his farm was a very profitable
one, he did not hesitate which course to pursue; and he took
another farm at Cossey, near Norwich, where he continued for some
time, and where he often preached to the people in the
village.</p>
<p>In March, 1802, he purchased a farm at the village of
Sprowston, only two miles from Norwich.&nbsp; Here he enjoyed the
society of his friends in the city, and in every respect his own
comfort and that of his family were improved by this
removal.&nbsp; His congregation increased, and the chapel in
which he preached became too small for all who wished to attend
his ministry.&nbsp; His friends were therefore desirous of
erecting a more commodious one, and purchased a piece of ground
for its erection.&nbsp; In September, 1812, he laid the first
stone, and Mr. Andrew Fuller preached on the occasion.</p>
<p>In 1814, he went on a begging tour for his meeting house, and
travelled through the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and
Cambridgeshire, and thence to London.&nbsp; In six weeks he
collected about &pound;400, but his exertions brought on a
serious illness.&nbsp; After his <a name="page489"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 489</span>return his family scarcely hoped for
his recovery.&nbsp; On May 4th, 1814, the new meeting house, in
St. Clement&rsquo;s, Norwich, was opened by Mr. M. Wilks of
London, and Mr. A. Fuller.&nbsp; The pastor was present, but in a
very feeble state of health.&nbsp; He recovered slowly in a few
weeks, and when his health was sufficiently restored, he made
another effort to diminish the debt on the new chapel.&nbsp;
Though he frequently considered himself to be in a dying state,
yet at every interval of ease he pursued his work with
unremitting ardour.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to relate all the
details of the few latter years of his life; the long journeys he
took in the years 1815 and 1816, were a proof of the generosity
of his heart.&nbsp; His last two years he spent in retirement,
yet in the performance of his ministerial duties; and ever ready
to advance the interests of his church, of his family, and of
mankind.</p>
<p>He was ill only four days previous to his death, which took
place on February 5th, 1819.&nbsp; When it was publicly known in
the city that he was no more, hundreds of people went to his
house to take a last look of him whom living they had so much
loved and respected.&nbsp; And the bitter tears of his surviving
relatives, the deep affliction of his friends, and the sorrow of
mourning multitudes, bore a sad testimony to his worth as a
husband, a father, a friend, a minister, a neighbour, and a
christian.</p>
<p>He died on his birthday, when he had attained the age of
seventy-one.&nbsp; His much valued friend, the Rev. W. Hull of
Norwich, spoke at his interment to a large assembly of sincere
mourners, and to a great <a name="page490"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 490</span>concourse of spectators.&nbsp; The
Rev. Mark Wilks of London, his nephew, preached a funeral sermon
on Sunday, February 14th, before a large congregation.&nbsp; The
deceased was buried under the pulpit where he had preached the
gospel for forty years.&nbsp; Of his family of twelve children,
including his four sons, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, none of
them and none of their descendants now live in Norwich.</p>
<h4><i>The Rev. John Alexander</i>.</h4>
<p>The Rev. John Alexander was the pastor of the Independent
Congregation in Prince&rsquo;s Street for a period of fifty
years.&nbsp; He was much beloved by all who knew him for his
kindly disposition and genuine piety.&nbsp; Bishop Stanley often
spoke of him in terms of the highest commendation as a christian
minister.&nbsp; He took an active interest in all the
philanthropic and educational movements of the district, and was
for some time the Chairman of the Board of Management of the
Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.&nbsp; After his death, on July
31st, 1868, a short memoir of him appeared in the <i>Norfolk
News</i>; and this memoir contained nearly the whole history of
Prince&rsquo;s Street Chapel in this city.&nbsp; We give the
following extracts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Alexander was born at Lancaster in
1792.&nbsp; Of his father, the Rev. William Alexander, our
deceased friend published an interesting <i>Memoir</i>; and, as
showing his own appreciation of the excellencies of his parents,
he placed on the title page these lines of
Cowper&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page491"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
491</span>&lsquo;My boast is, not that I deduce my birth<br />
From loins enthroned, and rulers of the earth;<br />
But higher far my proud pretensions rise,<br />
The son of parents passed into the skies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the same volume we find him thus writing in reference to
his early days:&mdash;&lsquo;The reader will, I trust, perceive
that our domestic discipline, union, and affection, together with
the sweet influences of religion, rendered us a happy
family.&nbsp; The recollections and the love of home, too, and
our reverence for holy parents, became a shield of protection to
us, and &ldquo;a way of escape&rdquo; in the day of
evil.&rsquo;&nbsp; With an atmosphere like this surrounding his
childhood, we wonder not that he became in early life the subject
of deep religious convictions.&nbsp; In 1807 he entered a large
commercial establishment connected with a household in which
&lsquo;the most beautiful domestic order was combined with
everything that was pure and lovely in religion.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This privilege was greatly prized by him, and he ever cherished a
grateful sense of the goodness of God in placing him there.&nbsp;
During this period he attended the ministry of the Rev. P. S.
Charrier of Liverpool, and joined the church under his
care.&nbsp; For some time he had cherished a desire, and
entertained a hope, in reference to the christian ministry, which
was now soon to be realised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The celebrated Dr. Edward Williams, one of the tutors
at Rotherham College, happened just then to visit Liverpool, and
unexpectedly spoke to him on the subject, offering him the
advantages of the institution over which he presided.&nbsp; This
incident naturally made a deep impression on his mind, and led
him very seriously and prayerfully to consider the matter.&nbsp;
Of course, he lost no time in communicating his thoughts to his
father, who urged on him the greatest caution, saying, &lsquo;God
forbid you should take it up, except in compliance <a
name="page492"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 492</span>with the
will of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nothing daunted, however, by the
somewhat discouraging aspect of the ministry set before him in
his father&rsquo;s letters, he intimated to him, in reply to his
inquiries, that he retained an unalterable &lsquo;determination
to give himself to the work, believing he had been called of God
to it;&rsquo; and in 1814 he was admitted as a student into
Hoxton College.&nbsp; Here the amiable qualities which
distinguished him all through life soon endeared him to every
fellow-student, and one still surviving speaks of hours spent
with him as &lsquo;the happiest, holiest, and most profitable
spent under the college roof.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his <i>Thirty Years&rsquo; History of the Church and
Congregation in Prince&rsquo;s Street Chapel</i>, he gives us an
account of his first visit to and subsequent residence in this
city.&nbsp; From that source we learn that early in the year 1817
he received an invitation to preach for a few Sabbaths in the
Tabernacle, and that on Friday, April 4th, 1817, (the day on
which a fatal steam-packet catastrophe occurred by which many
lives were lost), he entered Norwich.&nbsp; On the following
Sunday evening he preached from the text, &lsquo;Therefore be ye
also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man
cometh.&rsquo;&nbsp; The place was crowded; and, says he,
&lsquo;The Lord stood by me and strengthened me.&rsquo;&nbsp; At
the expiration of three Sabbaths he returned to London, promising
to visit Norwich again and preach during the whole of the
Midsummer vacation.&nbsp; He resumed his labours with very great
encouragement at the Tabernacle on July 6th; and some legal
difficulty occurring as to the power of appointing the minister,
he consented, with the approbation of his tutors, to continue
them till the disputed point was settled, which was not till the
following December.&nbsp; The legal decision was such as
necessitated him to give notice the very day it arrived, that in
the evening he should preach his last <a name="page493"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 493</span>sermon in the Tabernacle.&nbsp; On
that occasion he chose as his text, words which the people
believed to have been divinely suggested to his mind,
&lsquo;Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the
morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; That text, it was often afterwards
remarked, built the new chapel.&nbsp; The prospect, however, of
the toil connected with the establishment of a new church and
congregation, and the building of a chapel, was such that he
shrank from it, and took his place in the coach to return to
London on his way to Kidderminster, where he had been requested
to supply, with a view to settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But so deep was the impression his services had
produced, and so warm the interest and affection created, that
the people would not part from him.&nbsp; On the day of his
departure, a deputation waited on him and pressed on him an
invitation to become their minister with such affectionate
earnestness, that, says he &lsquo;I felt the appeal to be
irresistible, and I promised to lay the whole matter before my
tutor and friends, and to make it the subject of serious and
prayerful re-consideration.&rsquo;&nbsp; The result was that he
returned, and for some time preached in the Lancasterian
School-room.&nbsp; At length the site on which Prince&rsquo;s
Street Chapel now stands was purchased, and the foundation stone
laid on the 16th of March, 1819.&nbsp; It was opened on December
1st in the same year, and thenceforward, for the space of about
five and forty years, it continued to be the scene of the living
and life-quickening ministry of one whose &lsquo;praise is in all
the churches.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of the characteristics of Mr.
Alexander&rsquo;s preaching this is not the place to speak beyond
saying it was truly evangelical and eminently successful.&nbsp;
But he was not the preacher only.&nbsp; He was the faithful
pastor, the unswerving friend, and the cheerful companion as
well.&nbsp; Hence in times of sorrow or of joy he was a welcome
guest, either in the <a name="page494"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 494</span>family meeting or at more social
gatherings.&nbsp; He carried summer and sunshine with him into
every circle, and never left any without leaving a longing in
every heart, young and old, for the next visit.&nbsp; When he
crossed the threshold, the young loved to caress and to be
caressed by him, whilst to the others the cares of life seemed
lessened, and the burden lightened, as he spoke to them a few
words of loving sympathy or wise counsel, and left them with his
soft tones of benediction treasured in their hearts and vibrating
on their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time rolled on, ever finding him at his work, till
thirty years had gone, when his friends gathered round him in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall to testify their high appreciation of his
excellencies, and their deep and strong affection for him as
their pastor and their friend.&nbsp; On that occasion it was the
desire of the people to present a purse to him as a substantial
token of their esteem, but there being at that time a debt of
&pound;400 remaining on the chapel, he, with that characteristic
unselfishness which ever marked him, urgently requested that they
would abandon the purse, but remove the debt.&nbsp; But it must
not be supposed that Mr. Alexander&rsquo;s energies were confined
to the cause of Christ at Prince&rsquo;s Street Chapel, or that
the members of his church and congregation were allowed to claim
him as exclusively belonging to them.&nbsp; This was seen when
ten years more of active service had passed, and troops of
admirers, from far and near, flocked again to St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall to do him honour.&nbsp; On that occasion the Mayor (J. G.
Johnson, Esq.,) represented the city, and the Rev. S. Titlow the
Church of England, in most eulogistic speeches.&nbsp; The Baptist
Churches of the county presented him with an address, whilst
brethren of his own denomination, and others, lay and
ministerial, seemed to vie with one another in magnifying
&lsquo;the grace of God&rsquo; in him.&nbsp; <a
name="page495"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 495</span>The desire
entertained ten years before was now carried into effect, and a
purse, with an elegant skeleton timepiece, and a memorial
engrossed on vellum and framed, were presented to him, and a gold
watch and chain to Mrs. Alexander.&nbsp; The timepiece bore the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<p>Presented to the Rev. John Alexander, together with a purse of
500 sovereigns, on his commencing the fortieth year of his
ministry in Norwich, by the members of his congregation and
numerous other friends, as a memorial of Christian esteem and
love.&mdash;Norwich, June 3rd, 1856.</p>
<p>From that time the infirmities of age, and the claims of a
large congregation, led him to desire help, which was secured for
him in the person of an assistant minister.&nbsp; With that help
he happily and zealously worked on in his Master&rsquo;s service
through another decade of years, when once more the old Gothic
hall resounded with his praises and witnessed another outburst of
affectionate congratulation.&nbsp; Having lived to see the
jubilee of his ministry, he now resigned the pastoral office, and
was presented with an annuity of &pound;200 and a magnificent
epergne, on which a suitable inscription was engraved.&nbsp; With
trembling emotion the venerable man read his reply and
acknowledgment, in which, after recording the goodness of God and
the kindness of his friends through the long period of fifty
years, he stated that during his pastorate more than a thousand
members had been added to the church, two chapels had been added
to the one in Prince&rsquo;s Street, four Sunday Schools had been
raised and supplied with a hundred teachers and with nearly a
thousand children, and eight members of the church had become
ministers of the Gospel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seldom is it the lot of the most favoured ministers
thus to be blessed and made a blessing.&nbsp; We shall not
attempt <a name="page496"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
496</span>to describe what Mr. Alexander was in the pulpit, on
the platform, in the committee room, or from the press, nor how
he discharged his duties as chairman of &lsquo;The Congregational
Union of England and Wales,&rsquo; and secretary of &lsquo;The
Association for the Spread of the Gospel in the
County.&rsquo;&nbsp; Much less shall we venture a word on his
private or domestic life.&nbsp; We hope another and abler pen
will pourtray his character more fully, and hence we content
ourselves by adding words written by a friend, &lsquo;His life is
his eulogy.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a holy life, a useful life, an
honourable life, a happy life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last sermon Mr. Alexander preached was delivered in
Prince&rsquo;s Street Chapel on April 22nd, 1866, from 2
<i>Cor.</i> ii. 14&ndash;17.&nbsp; The last time that he spoke in
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall was a few months before his death, on the
occasion of the mayor&rsquo;s invitation to the Sunday school
teachers, and the last public religious service he attended was
in the Old Meeting House on Sunday evening, July 19th, 1868,
where his presence was ever as welcome as in his own chapel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of his history since his retirement into private life,
little only can be said.&nbsp; At first the ease and seeming
uselessness imposed on him by the infirmities of age had a
depressing influence on his mind, but latterly this gave place to
his wonted calm confidence in God, and his usual joyousness of
heart.&nbsp; Occasionally, to the grief of his friends, the
decline of his mental powers was painfully visible, but this was
often relieved by his still sparkling and felicitous utterances,
and his fervent devotional exercises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some lines written in our album so recently as last
November will, perhaps, best indicate the state of his mind, and
the theme on which it delighted to dwell:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page497"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
497</span>Amidst the fragrance richly shed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And beauty blooming in the bowers,<br />
The willow bends its mournful head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And seems to weep among the flowers.</p>
<p>And so in human life we find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How bright soever it appears,<br />
That grief is rooted in the mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And smiles are mingled with its tears.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a garden in the sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where mourning willows cannot grow,<br />
Where tears are wiped from every eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And streams of joy unmingled flow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now the time drew nigh that he must die.&nbsp; For
only a few days he was withdrawn from the outer world.&nbsp;
During that time it was very evident that constant intercourse
was being carried on with heaven.&nbsp; On asking him, two days
prior to his death, if the Saviour he had so long and faithfully
preached to others was now near and precious to himself, he
replied, &lsquo;Oh, what should I do without Him!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The day before his departure he was much in prayer.&nbsp; His
family were all remembered before God, as were also the servants
of the household.&nbsp; And very touching were the words in which
he sought a blessing on the ministers of the city, and on their
work, with whom he had lived in closest and loving
fellowship.&nbsp; And so he passed away, spending his last hours,
as he had spent his life, in blessing others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Tuesday, the 4th of August, he was carried to his
grave amid the lamentations of a vast concourse of his
fellow-citizens, and friends from the country, who had known him
and esteemed him very highly in love for his works&rsquo;
sake.&nbsp; The funeral service at the grave was conducted by the
Revs. G. Gould, J. Hallett, P. Colborne, and G. S. Barrett, B.A.;
but gathered there were clergymen and <a name="page498"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 498</span>ministers of every denomination, as
well as laymen of all classes, from the mayor to the humblest

<p>&ldquo;And so has passed away from our midst, full of days and
honours, one, whom it was a privilege to have known, and an
impossibility not to have loved.&nbsp; His Christian catholicity,
his large-hearted charity, his generous liberality, his
untarnished reputation, and his fidelity to Christian truth,
together with other virtues that adorned his long life, constrain
us to thank God for having given him to Norwich, and, now that He
has taken him to Himself, constrain us to say &lsquo;Let me die
the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like
his!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The funeral sermon was preached by the Rev. John Stoughton, of
London, before a large congregation in St. Andrew&rsquo;s

<h4><i>The Gurney Family</i>.</h4>
<p>The members of the Gurney family, from an early period, have
been distinguished by their station, wealth, and intelligence,
both in Norfolk and Norwich.&nbsp; Memoirs of Joseph John Gurney,
with selections from his journal and correspondence, were edited
by Joseph Bevan Braithwaite, and published by Mr. Fletcher of
this city.&nbsp; From these memoirs we derive the following
interesting details respecting the family, and the Society of
Friends in Norwich.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The family of Gurney or Gournay is said to
have sprung from a house of Norman barons, who followed William
the Conqueror into England and obtained a large estate in this
country, chiefly in the county of Norfolk.&nbsp; From them <a
name="page499"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 499</span>descended a
long line of country gentlemen, who maintained themselves at
Harpley, and West Barsham, in this county, for many generations,
and from a very early period had one of their residences in this
city.&nbsp; The last of these dying without male issue, about the
commencement of the reign of Charles II., the old family estates
at that period became dispersed amongst females.&nbsp; The name
of Gurney was, however, honourably continued through a descendant
of one of the younger sons of an earlier generation, John Gurney,
the ancestor of the present family.&nbsp; He was born in the year
1655, and notwithstanding his family connections, commenced life
in Norwich in somewhat straitened circumstances.&nbsp; Devoting
himself in his youth to the cause of religion, we find him in the
year 1678, at the age of twenty-three, already connected with the
oppressed, persecuted Quakers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The family of John Gurney appear previously to have had
some connexion with the Puritans.&nbsp; Henry Gurney, indeed, of
West Barsham, the representative of the family in the early part
of the 17th century, had a distaste for Puritanism, if, at least,
we are to judge from the insertion in his will (proved in 1623)
of a special charge to his younger son, &lsquo;That none hould
any fantisticall or erroneous opinions, so adjudged by our bishop
or civill lawes.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Edmund Gurney, rector of
Harpley, one of these younger sons, who was a person of
influence, became known as a zealous Puritan; he declined wearing
the surplice, and was probably among those who took the covenant
in 1643.&nbsp; After him John Gurney successively named two of
his children.&nbsp; Others of his connexions were also inclined
to Puritanism, and some of them, like himself, joined the Society
of Friends.&nbsp; In the case of the early Friends generally,
their ultimate settlement in those gospel principles by which
they became distinguished from others, was preceded by a state of
much religious <a name="page500"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
500</span>awakening and earnest seeking after God, in which they
&lsquo;searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through what course of experience John Gurney arrived
at his conviction, the scanty materials of his history do not
inform us.&nbsp; Let it suffice us to know that what he became
convinced of, was precious to him as the truth, and that for it
he was prepared to suffer.&nbsp; On the 29th of the ninth month
(O. S.), 1682, (so the records of the Friends in Norwich inform
us,) &lsquo;Friends being kept out of their meeting house, met
together in the street to wait upon the Lord,&rsquo; and, being
there, John Gurney and another Friend, were violently pulled out
from among the rest, as if they had been malefactors, and carried
before a justice of the peace, by whom, as they declined giving,
on such an account, the required bail, they were committed until
the next quarter sessions.&nbsp; In the following year, 1683, he
was again imprisoned, for refusing to take an oath, and continued
in prison, under successive recommitments, nearly three
years.&nbsp; He died in the year 1721, having greatly prospered
in his temporal concerns; and, what is far more important,
having, according to the testimony of those who knew him, taken
particular care in the religious education of all his children,
and continued faithful to the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His two elder sons, John and Joseph, were both men of
marked character.&nbsp; John was gifted with much natural
eloquence, and obtained considerable reputation by the spirit and
ability with which he successfully defended the Norwich trade,
before a committee of the House of Lords, against some
apprehended encroachments.&nbsp; He subsequently received from
Sir Robert Walpole the offer of a seat in parliament, which,
however, he declined as inconsistent with his religious
principles in the then state of the law.&nbsp; Religion had early
taken possession of his heart, and about the 22nd <a
name="page501"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 501</span>year of his
age, in obedience to the call of apprehended duty, he had yielded
himself to the work of the public ministry of the gospel, in
which service he laboured diligently for many years; neither the
temptation of prosperity nor the kindness and esteem of great men
of this world, being, in the simple and forcible language of the
memorial respecting him, &lsquo;permitted to separate him from
that truth which the Lord had eminently convinced him
of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides numerous other descendants, he was the
grandfather of Martha Birkbeck, whose daughter Jane became the
first wife of Joseph John Gurney.&nbsp; Joseph Gurney, his
younger brother, who, towards the close of his life, fixed his
residence at Keswick, near Norwich, also became a valued minister
of the gospel among Friends.&nbsp; His christian profession was
eminently adorned by a life of humility, benevolence, and
moderation.&nbsp; He died in the year 1750, after a suffering
illness which he bore with exemplary resignation, giving a final
evidence of the truth of what he then expressed that it had been
&lsquo;the business of his whole life to be prepared for such a
time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His eldest son, John Gurney, was a man of great
activity and energy, and notwithstanding his extensive
engagements in business, devoted much of his time to the
interests of his own religious society, to the principles of
which he was warmly attached.&nbsp; In the midst of a course of
remarkable temporal prosperity, it is instructive to observe the
fears which he expresses in one of his private memoranda, lest
his increasing opulence should lead away his children from those
religious habits and associations in which they had been
educated.&nbsp; He left three sons, all of whom married and
settled near Norwich.&nbsp; Richard Gurney the eldest, on his
father&rsquo;s decease, in 1770, became the occupant of the
family residence at Keswick.&nbsp; John Gurney, the father of <a
name="page502"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 502</span>J. J.
Gurney, had previously to the birth of the latter settled at
Earlham.&nbsp; Joseph Gurney, the youngest, resided at Lakenham
Grove.&nbsp; The three families were naturally much associated,
and exercised an important influence upon each other.&nbsp; At a
later period especially, the consistency with which Joseph
Gurney, of The Grove, was enabled to maintain his position as a
Friend, and as a christian minister, rendered his influence
peculiarly valuable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Gurney, of Earlham, is eulogised highly by the editor of
these memoirs as generous, ardent, and warm-hearted, abounding in
kindness to all, uniting very remarkable activity, both in public
and private business, with an acute intellect and extensive
information.&nbsp; His wife was Catherine Bell, a daughter of
Daniel Bell of Stamford Hill, near London, her mother being a
granddaughter of Robert Barclay, the well-known author of the
&ldquo;Apology.&rdquo;&nbsp; She is described as a woman of very
superior mind as well as personal charms, and as a serious
christian and decided Friend.&nbsp; She died in the autumn of
1792, leaving her sorrowing husband the widowed parent of eleven
children.&nbsp; The following list of the names may be found
useful:&mdash;</p>
<p>Catherine died unmarried, 1850.</p>

<h5><i>Joseph John Gurney</i>, <i>Esq.</i></h5>
<p>Among the eminent citizens of this century, none will take a
higher place than the late J. J. Gurney, Esq., the well-known
philanthropist.&nbsp; He was born at Earlham Hall on August 8th,
1788.&nbsp; That hall was one of the happiest homes in
England.&nbsp; It was also the birth-place of Mrs. Elizabeth Fry,
sister of J. J. Gurney, and almost as celebrated as her
brother.&nbsp; Here they were both trained with religious care,
and passed their days of childhood and youth in happiness and
peace.&nbsp; In after life they were associated together in works
of benevolence, and the brother often aided his sister in many of
her schemes for improving prison discipline.</p>
<p>In 1803, soon after he had completed his 15th year, Joseph
John was sent to Oxford with his cousin Gurney Barclay to pursue
his studies under the care of John Rogers, a private tutor.&nbsp;
Young J. J. Gurney continued at Oxford two years, with the
exception of the vacations, which he spent mostly at home.&nbsp;
His tutor, though resident at Oxford, was not in that character
connected with the university or with any of the colleges.&nbsp;
The student became an excellent classical and oriental scholar,
and ultimately the author of several valuable religious works,
such as &ldquo;Essays on Christianity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thoughts on
Habit and Discipline.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page504"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 504</span>He was scarcely seventeen when, in
August, 1805, he was removed from the care of John Rogers.&nbsp;
He had become attached to his tutor and to his studies, and he
quitted the place with regret, but there was brightness in the
thought of settling at home.&nbsp; The bank in which his father
was a partner had been established in Norwich in the year
1770.&nbsp; After that time the concern was considerably extended
with branch banks at Lynn, Fakenham, Yarmouth, and other
places.&nbsp; His elder brother, John, had been placed in the
establishment at Lynn, and his brother Samuel had been sent up to
London, where he had become the head of a district concern; so
that circumstances had prepared the way for that which J. J.
Gurney himself had desired&mdash;a place in the bank at
Norwich.&nbsp; Here in the enjoyment of daily communication with
his father, and a home at Earlham with his sisters, the ensuing
three years of his life passed in peace and joy.&nbsp; In the
year 1806, he accompanied his father and a large family party in
a tour to the English lakes and through Scotland.&nbsp; On their
return, J. J. Gurney was regular in his attendance at the bank,
but he found time for study at home, and he carefully read
ancient historians in the original languages.&nbsp; Gradually,
however, his attention became unceasingly directed to biblical
literature, which continued for some years to absorb much of his
leisure.&nbsp; His habits of study were eminently methodical,
exemplifying his favourite maxim, which he was afterwards
accustomed strongly to inculcate upon his young friends,
&ldquo;Be a whole man to one thing at a <a
name="page505"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
505</span>time.&rdquo;&nbsp; His position and tastes introduced
him to the highly-cultivated society, for which Norwich was at
the time remarkable, at the house of his cousin Hudson Gurney,
where he was accustomed to meet many persons who were eminent for
their parts and learning.&nbsp; He had early become a favourite
with Dr. Bathurst, then Bishop of Norwich, and their intercourse
gradually ripened into a warm friendship, which was maintained
unbroken till that prelate&rsquo;s decease, in 1837, at the very
advanced age of ninety-three.&nbsp; Young J. J. Gurney was but
just twenty-one when, as one of his father&rsquo;s executors and
representative at Earlham, and as a partner in the bank, very
grave responsibilities devolved upon him.&nbsp; However, he
continued to pursue his studies with ardour, and he made his
first essay as an author in an article published in the
<i>Classical Journal</i> on September 9th, 1810, under the title
of &ldquo;A Critical Notice of Sir William Drummond&rsquo;s
Dissertations on the Herculanesia.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this effort
his mind became increasingly drawn towards the principles of the
Society of Friends, and many of his allusions to his feelings, in
his autobiography, are peculiarly interesting and instructive,
indicating the spiritual phase of his mind.&nbsp; The example of
his sister, Elizabeth Fry, as well as of his sister Priscilla,
who like her, had become a decided Friend and a preacher of the
gospel, strengthened his convictions; but the influence of other
members of the family who resided at Earlham, as well as of many
other estimable persons, tended in an opposite direction.&nbsp;
The editor of the Memoirs, already referred to, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page506"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
506</span>&ldquo;Whilst Joseph John Gurney&rsquo;s religious
convictions were thus gradually drawing him into a narrower path
in connection with the Society of Friends, his heart was becoming
increasingly enlarged in Christian concern for the welfare of
others.&nbsp; He had already warmly interested himself in the
formation of a Lancasterian School in Norwich, an institution
which long continued to have his effective support.&nbsp; The
establishment of an auxiliary Bible Society in this city, was an
object into which he now entered with youthful ardour.&nbsp; The
general meeting for its formation was held on the 11th of the 9th
month, 1811.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The philanthropist was married to Jane Birkbeck on October
10th, 1817, in his 29th year, and it appears to have been a very
happy marriage.&nbsp; The event took place at Wells Meeting, and,
after a short sojourn at Hunstanton, the newly-married couple
travelled to their home at Earlham, where they received the
visits of many friends, who were most hospitably
entertained.&nbsp; After his marriage, J. J. Gurney continued at
Earlham; and the hall, where his father had resided, and in which
he himself lived from his birth, was his settled residence.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To this place (with its lovely lawn nested
among large trees) he was strongly attached all his life.&nbsp;
And they who knew him there can still picture him in his study
among his books, or in his drawing-room among his friends, his
countenance beaming with love and intelligence, the life of the
whole circle; or in his garden amongst his flowers, with his
Greek Testament in his hand, still drawing from the books
&lsquo;of nature and of grace&rsquo; that lay open before him,
new motives to raise the heart to the Author of all his
blessings.</p>
<p><a name="page507"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
507</span>&ldquo;Placed by circumstances, though not the elder
brother, in the position which his father had occupied in Norfolk
as Master of Earlham, and a partner in the bank, it was his
delight, as far as possible, to continue Earlham as the family
house.&nbsp; Even after his marriage, his sisters, Catherine,
Rachel, and Priscilla, continued to live with him, occupying
their own apartments, and it was the custom of the other members
of the family frequently to meet there as under a common roof. *
* * Up to the period of his brother John&rsquo;s decease, and for
some time afterwards, it was the habit of his brothers and
himself, with their brothers-in-law, Thomas Fowell Buxton and
Samuel Hoare, to improve these occasions by a mutual impartial
examination of their conduct, in which each with brotherly
openness stated what he conceived to be the brother&rsquo;s
faults.&nbsp; Happy indeed was such an intercourse between such
minds. * * * Besides this, to him, delightful band of brothers
and sisters, his house was, as must have been already apparent to
the reader, freely opened to a large circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst every year strengthened his conviction of the
soundness and importance of the christian principles which he
professed, he rejoiced in that liberty wherewith Christ had made
him free to embrace as brethren all those in whom he thought he
could discern traces of his heavenly image.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Towards the close of the year (1817) in company with
his wife, his brother Samuel Gurney, his brother and sister
Buxton, and Francis and Richenda Cunningham, he took a short tour
upon the continent of Europe, their principal objects being to
establish a branch Bible Society in Paris, and to procure
information as to the systems of prison discipline adopted in the
jails of Antwerp and Ghent.&nbsp; Having accomplished their
objects, they returned home after an absence of about a
month.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page508"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 508</span>Soon
afterwards J. J. Gurney began to preach at meetings of the
Friends in Norwich and elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Early in the year 1818, private business
called him to London.&nbsp; His sister, Elizabeth Fry, had
previously entered upon her important labours for the benefit of
the prisoners in Newgate, and for the improvement of prison
discipline generally.&nbsp; Joseph John Gurney warmly entered
into his sister&rsquo;s views, and accompanied her to the
committee of the House of Commons on the occasion of giving her
evidence, and afterwards to Lord Sidmouth, then Secretary of
State for the Home Department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His visit to London and the pamphlet on <i>Prison
Discipline</i>, soon afterward published by his brother-in-law,
Thomas Fowell Buxton, tended to deepen in his own mind a sense of
the importance of that subject, and an opportunity soon occurred
for endeavouring to influence the authorities at Norwich to some
exertion respecting it.&nbsp; The mayor and corporation, attended
by the sheriffs and other citizens, whilst perambulating the
boundaries of the county of the city, were by his desire invited
to partake of refreshment in passing by the hall at
Earlham.&nbsp; Besides those immediately connected with the
magistracy many others assembled, the whole company consisting of
about 800 persons.&nbsp; On this occasion, Joseph John Gurney, in
an address to the mayor and corporation, urged the erection of a
new jail, and its establishment on better principles, with a view
to the employment of the prisoners, and the improvement of their
morals; enforcing his appeal by a reference to the extraordinary
change that had then recently taken place in Newgate, through the
exertions of a committee of ladies, and concluding by offering a
donation of &pound;100 towards the object.&nbsp; The effort was
not without fruit, though the result was not immediately
apparent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page509"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 509</span>The
editor of his Memoirs proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the 8th and 9th month of this year
(1818), in company with his wife, his sister Elizabeth Fry, and
one of her daughters, he took a journey into Scotland, visiting
many of the prisons both there and in the north of England,
besides attending many of the meetings of Friends.&nbsp; On this
occasion, in conformity with the christian order established in
the Society of Friends, he was furnished with a minute or
testimonial expressing the concurrence of his Friends of his own
&lsquo;Monthly Meeting&rsquo; in his prospects of religious
service.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have now to view the philanthropist not only in the varied
relations of private life, but also in the very important
character of a christian minister.&nbsp; He gradually became the
most distinguished member of the Society of Friends in all
England, and he often delivered exceedingly impressive discourses
in Norwich and other large towns, preaching the gospel with a
peculiar grace of manner which fascinated every audience.&nbsp;
We have often heard him preach before large congregations of
educated people in the Meeting House at Liverpool, and always
with great effect.&nbsp; His journal is full of details of his
labours in all parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland.&nbsp; He
became a Home Missionary, working hard at his own expense; but we
must confine this brief sketch to his doings here in
Norwich.&nbsp; The death of his beloved wife at Earlham on
October 6th, 1822, put his religious principle to the severest
test, and in his letters he expresses deep sorrow, but he was of
too active a disposition to be long subdued by grief.&nbsp;
During the few months succeeding his loss, he continued mostly <a
name="page510"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 510</span>at home in
the enjoyment of the society of his sisters, Catherine and
Rachel; his children becoming increasingly the objects of his
tender solicitude.&nbsp; In the mean time, besides attending to
the necessary claims of business, and to the various public
objects that had long shared his interest, he devoted his leisure
to study, finding relief, as he intimates, &ldquo;Not in the
indulgence of sorrow, but in a diligent attention to the calls of
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After giving many extracts from his journal, Mr. Braithwaite
continues in reference to the anti-slavery agitation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Retiring for a few days to Cromer Hall, he
found a large and interesting circle.&nbsp; Amongst others, the
late William Wilberforce and Zachary Macaulay were there,
deliberating with his brother-in-law Thomas Fowell Buxton on the
position and prospects of the Anti-Slavery question.&nbsp; It was
the occasion on which the latter appears to have arrived at his
final decision, to accept the responsible post of advocate of the
cause as successor to Wilberforce.&nbsp; In this important
undertaking, and throughout the succeeding struggle, Joseph John
Gurney gave him his warm and efficient encouragement and
support.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. J. J. Gurney, Mr. Clarkson, Mr. T. F. Buxton, Mr.
Wilberforce, and others, were earnest advocates for the total
abolition of the slave trade and of slavery; and they attended
many public meetings at which they denounced and exposed the
horrid traffic.&nbsp; Ultimately, as we all know, their efforts
were rewarded, by rousing public indignation to such a pitch as
to <a name="page511"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
511</span>result in the passing of an act of parliament
emancipating the slaves in the West Indies, at a cost of twenty
millions.</p>
<p>The panic in the monetary and commercial world, and the sudden
run upon the banks in London and the country, have rendered the
winter of 1825&ndash;1826 memorable.&nbsp; As a banker, J. J.
Gurney did not escape his share of anxiety, as appears from his
journal, but his firm weathered the storm.&nbsp; Another
circumstance was at this time deeply interesting to his feelings,
namely, his attachment to Mary Fowler, daughter of Rachel Fowler,
a cousin of his late wife.&nbsp; After some correspondence he
made Mary Fowler an offer of marriage, which she accepted.&nbsp;
On July 18th, 1827, they were married at Elm Grove.&nbsp; On this
interesting occasion, he remarks in his journal,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bright, hopeful, and happy was our wedding
day.&nbsp; We dined on the lawn, a large united company, and
rejoiced together, I trust in the Lord.&nbsp; Mary and I left the
party at Elm Grove, in the afternoon, for North Devon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They arrived at Linton, and thence proceeded to
Ilfracombe.&nbsp; There they spent the honeymoon, and then the
happy husband brought his second wife home to Earlham, where they
were received with joy.&nbsp; After this he was visited by many
eminent characters at Earlham, including Dr. Chalmers, who stayed
with him several days.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;None can have attentively perused the
foregoing pages&rdquo; (says the editor of the memoirs)
&ldquo;without perceiving that one leading feature of Joseph John
Gurneys character was <a name="page512"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 512</span>an unweared active
benevolence.&nbsp; Like his sister, Elizabeth Fry, he seemed
continually to live under a deep sense of his responsibility
towards others.&nbsp; A cheerful and bountiful giver, it was not
merely by large pecuniary assistance that he proved his interest
in objects connected with the welfare of his fellow-men: to these
objects he was exemplary in devoting no common share of his time
and personal attention.&nbsp; The steady devotion to the
Anti-slavery and Bible Societies is already before the
reader.&nbsp; In addition to these great and often absorbing
interests, his exertions for the distressed labouring population
of Norwich were unremitting.&nbsp; Year after year, during the
winter, or on any occasion when their distress was aggravated by
want of employment, he was at his post, stirring up his
fellow-citizens to the necessary measures for the alleviation of
their wants.&nbsp; The District Visiting Society, which was
mainly instrumental in originating the Soup Society and the Coal
Society, found in him a steady and effective supporter.&nbsp;
Often would he say that the painful consciousness of the poverty
and suffering of many thousands around him, almost prevented his
enjoyment of the abundant blessings with which he was himself so
richly favoured.&nbsp; On one occasion he expended a considerable
sum in providing the capital for an attempt to supply the poor
weavers and mechanics with employment during a scarcity of
work.&nbsp; But, though like many similar attempts, it failed to
answer the expectation of the promoter, and was abandoned, it
served at least to furnish another proof of the sincerity and
earnestness with which he laboured for their welfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The depressions in trade occasioned by the panic of
1825 will be long remembered.&nbsp; Norwich did not escape its
influence.&nbsp; As a banker, Joseph John Gurney was more than
usually absorbed in his own immediate cares, but his <a
name="page513"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 513</span>heart at
once turned towards his suffering fellow-citizens.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The dreadful distress,&rsquo; he writes to a friend,
&lsquo;which prevails in the great mass of our once labouring,
now, alas! idle population, has been such as to call forth my
strenuous efforts on their behalf.&nbsp; In this, success has
been mercifully vouchsafed.&nbsp; We have raised &pound;3300 in
five days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more illustration deserves notice.&nbsp; In the
winter of 1829&ndash;30, the manufactures of Norwich were again
greatly depressed.&nbsp; The weavers became unsettled, holding
riotous meetings, and using threatening language against their
employers.&nbsp; The state of things was alarming.&nbsp; J. J.
Gurney felt it to be his duty to use his influence in checking
the spirit of discontent that was rapidly spreading.&nbsp; He
attended one of the very large and tumultuous meetings of the
operatives, and endeavoured to persuade them to desist from their
disorderly proceedings, and quietly to resume their work.&nbsp;
With a view of still further winning them by kindness, he invited
a deputation from those assembled to breakfast at Earlham on the
following morning.&nbsp; Between forty and fifty of them came,
with Dover, a notorious Chartist leader, at their head.&nbsp;
After the usual family reading of the Scriptures, they sat down
to a plentiful repast which had been provided for them in the
large dining room, of which they partook heartily; and their host
afterwards addressed them in a kind, conciliatory manner upon the
subject of wages, and their duty to their employers.&nbsp; The
men conducted themselves in an orderly manner and appeared
grateful for the attention shown them.&nbsp; The scene was not
soon to be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The editor gives some illustrations of the
philanthropist&rsquo;s benevolent character, by narrating
instances of his visits to prisoners in the Jail, and to
afflicted inmates of the Bethel and the Norfolk and Norwich <a
name="page514"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
514</span>Hospital.&nbsp; A volume might be filled by an account
of his acts of private benevolence, but we must pass on to more
public matters.&nbsp; He seldom took an active part in contested
elections, but at the election in 1833, after the passing of the
Reform Act, the Whig candidates, one of whom was his near
relative, were defeated, chiefly, as was generally believed,
through the influence of bribery.&nbsp; On this subject J. J.
Gurney wrote,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As usual, I took little or no interest in
the election, but when a petition was presented to Parliament
against the returned members on the score of bribery, I imagined
it to be my place to subscribe to the object, and wrote a letter
in the Norwich newspapers stating the grounds of my so
doing.&nbsp; Those grounds were in no degree personal, but simply
moral and Christian.&nbsp; But the appearance of evil was not
avoided.&nbsp; The measure was construed into an act of political
partizanship; and I entirely lost ground by it in my own true
calling, that of promoting simple Christianity among all
classes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had thought of becoming a candidate for the representation
of this city, or some other place, in Parliament.&nbsp; After
some long conferences with his friends he abandoned the idea and
devoted himself to his higher calling.&nbsp; Mr. J. J. Gurney was
a well-known Liberal in politics, but he did not often speak at
political meetings in this city.&nbsp; His speeches were always
short and generally pertinent; and showed good sense accompanied
with the seriousness of conviction.&nbsp; On whatever side of any
question he spoke he was listened to very attentively, and all
parties believed that he delivered the unbiassed opinion of an
honest man.&nbsp; <a name="page515"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
515</span>His conduct on every occasion gained him the esteem of
all friends of civil and religious liberty.</p>
<p>In 1835, he was once more plunged into deep affliction by the
long illness and death of his wife.&nbsp; Her health had of late
years been much improved, and she had been unremitting in her
attentions to his daughter during her illness from typhus fever,
without apparently suffering in consequence.&nbsp; The disease
was, however, lurking in her constitution, and after some time
made its appearance.&nbsp; The fever gradually gained ground, and
she sank under it on Nov. 9th of that year.&nbsp; She died
happily, amid her mourning friends; and her husband knelt down at
her bedside and returned thanks for her deliverance from every
trouble!</p>
<p>His journal contains many details of his visits to Manchester
and Liverpool, of his journeys in Derbyshire and North Wales, of
his journeys in Scotland and the north of England, of his voyage
to America, of his journey to Ohio, Indiana, and North Carolina,
of his journey from Richmond to Washington, of interviews with
eminent statesmen, of labours at New York, of a voyage to the
West Indies and proceedings there, of a tour on the continent,
and of his return home.&nbsp; But we cannot follow him in all his
wanderings in many lands, where he went about doing good,
promoting benevolent objects and preaching the gospel, his heart
being too large to be confined to his native country, much less
to his native city.&nbsp; On his return from the continent in
1841, he attended a meeting of the Bible Society, and delivered
his last <a name="page516"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
516</span>great speech, which occupied two hours, on the state of
religion in Europe.&nbsp; A shorthand writer took notes of that
address, which was so full of information that it was afterwards
published in the Journal of the Bible Society.</p>
<p>Soon after his return home he married Eliza P.
Kirkbridge.&nbsp; The event took place at Darlington, on October
10th, 1841, as noted in his journal.&nbsp; After the marriage he
delivered an address on the &ldquo;Victory which is of
faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dinner party was cheerful, and concluded
with a short religious service.&nbsp; He and his bride parted
from their friends, made a short tour, and returned to Earlham,
which they &ldquo;reached in health and great peace, the place
comfortable and homeish, and the reception from his dearest
children glowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>J. J. Gurney signed the total-abstinence pledge at the house
of his friend, Richard Dykes Alexander, at Ipswich, on April 8th,
1843.&nbsp; He and his wife attended a great &ldquo;Teetotal
Meeting&rdquo; held at Norwich, on the arrival of Father Mathew,
on September 9th, that year.&nbsp; The lord bishop, Dr. Stanley,
was present and requested J. J. Gurney to preside.&nbsp; He did
so, and declared himself to be a pledged teetotaller.&nbsp; He
spoke fully and carefully on the subject, and the lord bishop
afterwards expressed his admiration of the apostle of temperance
as the instrument of effecting so much moral good.</p>
<p>As a man of business, Mr. J. J. Gurney was ready, punctual,
and attentive.&nbsp; He was very modest, but of a candid and
social disposition.&nbsp; Though in large or <a
name="page517"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 517</span>mixed
companies he seldom appeared forward, yet in the society of his
friends he was exceedingly agreeable.&nbsp; In private life no
man was more estimable as a husband, a father, a neighbour, and a
friend.&nbsp; In Norwich and in the surrounding district he was
universally honoured and beloved.&nbsp; He was a great reader of
the bible, and he was regular and exact in family worship, but he
was a stranger to bigotry, no stickler for forms, and no friend
to mysticism in matters of religion.</p>
<p>The autumn of 1846 was spent by the philanthropist quietly at
home, with the exception of engagements connected with the
attendance of meetings of Friends, and with what proved to be a
farewell visit to his beloved daughter at Darlington, and to his
friends in several places on his way home.&nbsp; He attended a
committee of the Norwich District Visiting Society on December
28th in that year, and on his return to Earlham he complained of
great exhaustion, feverishness, &amp;c.&nbsp; A few simple
remedies were administered, but the uncomfortable symptoms
remaining his medical man was summoned on the following
morning.&nbsp; He pronounced it a slight bilious attack, and
seemed to have no anxiety about the recovery.&nbsp; The
philanthropist, however, gradually sank, apparently from
exhaustion, and he died on January 4th, 1847, in the 59th year of
his age.&nbsp; The news of his death spread a gloom over the
city, and the universal lamentations of the citizens proved that
they regarded him as a father and a friend, as indeed he had been
to thousands of them.&nbsp; The sensation in Norwich and its
neighbourhood <a name="page518"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
518</span>cannot easily be described, and is probably without
precedent in the case of a mere private individual.&nbsp; During
the entire interval of seven days between his decease and the
funeral, the half-closed shops and the darkened windows of the
houses gave ample proof of the feelings of the inhabitants.&nbsp;
It furnished the principal topic of conversation in every family,
in every private circle, in every group by the wayside.&nbsp;
People of all ranks vied with each other in their eulogies of
their departed friend.&nbsp; Everyone had his own story to tell
of some public benefit, or of some private kindness which had
been shown to others or to himself.</p>
<p>The funeral, as might have been expected from this unusual
public emotion, was an extraordinary scene.&nbsp; All the shops
were closed and all business was suspended in the city.&nbsp; A
number of gentlemen, including the mayor, the ex-mayor, and the
sheriff, went out in carriages as far as Earlham Hall.&nbsp; The
citizens generally formed the funeral procession, and followed
the hearse and plain carriages from the hall to the burial place
at the Gildencroft.&nbsp; There was no pomp or parade, no mockery
of woe.&nbsp; A simplicity in harmony with the character of the
departed marked all the arrangements.&nbsp; As the procession
moved on towards the city it was joined by an increasing number
of the inhabitants, who issued forth in a continuous stream to
pay their last tribute to the memory of departed worth.&nbsp;
Silently and sadly many stood while the hearse passed slowly by,
and many a tearful countenance among the crowd bore testimony to
their <a name="page519"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
519</span>love for the dead.&nbsp; The procession gradually
increased in numbers all the way to the Gildencroft, and after
the thousands of people had gathered round the grave a profound
silence ensued, which was at length broken by a Friend repeating
the verses, &ldquo;O death, where is thy sting?&nbsp; O grave,
where is thy victory?&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Another pause then
took place, followed by another address, and then the body was
lowered into its last resting place.&nbsp; The circle of mourning
relatives, including J. H. Gurney and his wife, the surrounding
crowd of spectators&mdash;persons of all ranks, of all ages, of
all communions&mdash;magistrates and artizans, clergymen and
Nonconformists&mdash;representatives, in short, of the whole
people of Norwich, now took their last farewell of Joseph John
Gurney, and slowly turned towards the meeting house, where a
meeting for worship was to be held.&nbsp; The service was deeply
impressive, and formed an appropriate conclusion to the solemn
occasion.&nbsp; At the Cathedral, on the following Sunday, the
good Bishop Stanley preached a funeral sermon before a large
congregation.&nbsp; His text was &ldquo;Watchman, what of the
night?&rdquo; and after enlarging on it, he alluded in a most
pathetic and impressive manner to the virtues of the deceased,
and we never before saw so many people so deeply moved.&nbsp; The
death of the beloved citizen was also publicly adverted to in
most of the places of worship in Norwich.</p>
<p>Mr. J. J. Gurney was the author of various works, the most
popular being one on the <i>Evidences of Christianity</i>.&nbsp;
It is a production more calculated to <a name="page520"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 520</span>confirm the faith of a believer than
to convert a free thinker who may not admit the possibility of
anything supernatural.&nbsp; He also published a work on
&ldquo;The Vows and Practices of Friends;&rdquo; &ldquo;Essays on
Christianity;&rdquo; &ldquo;Essays on the Moral Character of
Christ,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love to God;&rdquo; &ldquo;The Papal
and Hierarchical System compared with the Religion of the New
Testament, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; His last and best work is
entitled, &ldquo;Thoughts on Habit and Discipline,&rdquo; an
excellent moral treatise.</p>
<h4><i>Bishop Bathurst</i>.</h4>
<p>Henry Bathurst, LL.D., canon of Christchurch, rector of
Cirencester, and prebend of Durham, was installed bishop of
Norwich in 1805.&nbsp; He was a prelate much esteemed and
respected.&nbsp; His christian deportment, conciliatory manners,
and general benevolence, endeared him to this city and
diocese.&nbsp; He was eminently distinguished for his liberal
sentiments, and for his attachment to the great principles of
civil and religious liberty.&nbsp; He was often seen walking arm
in arm with Dissenters in our streets.&nbsp; He voted in the
House of Peers for the Repeal of the Catholic Disabilities Bill,
and also in favour of the Reform Bill.&nbsp; This disinterested
and noble advocacy of liberal principles is thought to have stood
in the way of his promotion to an archbishopric.&nbsp; He died
April 7th, 1837, in the 93rd year of his age, and much
lamented.&nbsp; A statue to his memory was placed in the choir of
the <a name="page521"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
521</span>Cathedral.&nbsp; This beautiful work of art was the
last work of Sir Francis Chantrey, and is executed in his
masterly style from a block of the purest Carrara marble.&nbsp;
It is placed on a plain pedestal of white marble, and fixed in
the recess at the foot of the altar steps, on the north side of
the choir, commonly called Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s seat, because
she sat there when she visited Norwich.&nbsp; The bishop is
represented in a sitting posture, clothed in full ecclesiastical
costume, and the artist has admirably succeeded in giving to his
face that expression of benevolence for which he was so well
known.</p>
<p>The following is a translation of the Latin inscription on the
pedestal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">To the Memory of<br />
The Right Reverend Father in Christ,<br />
HENRY BATHURST, Doctor in Civil Law,<br />
Who,<br />
While for more than 30 years he presided over<br />
This Diocese,<br />
By his frankness and purity of heart,<br />
Gentleness of manners, and pleasantness of conversation, attached
to himself the good will of all:<br />
His friends,<br />
In testimony of their regret for one so much beloved,<br />
Have caused this effigy to be erected.<br />
He died 5 Ap. <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1837, in the
93rd year<br />
Of his age.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="page522"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
522</span><i>Bishop Stanley</i>.</h4>
<p>Dr. Stanley was born January 1st, 1779, and became rector of
Alderley, in Cheshire.&nbsp; After twice declining the office, he
was installed bishop of Norwich, August 17th, 1837.&nbsp; He
ruled the diocese for twelve years, and was highly esteemed by
all sects for his unceasing efforts to promote the spiritual
interests of every class of society, and his readiness on every
occasion to co-operate with Dissenters in every good work.&nbsp;
He often attended their meetings to promote religious and
benevolent objects.&nbsp; In one of his sermons he quoted the
injunction &ldquo;The servant of the Lord must not strive, but be
gentle unto all men; in meekness instructing those that oppose
themselves;&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; His subsequent conduct furnished
ample evidence of the sincerity with which he obeyed this
injunction; and although some of his clergy were somewhat
estranged from him by his frequent expressions of unbounded
charity, yet all were obliged to esteem him for his noble zeal
and consistency of character.&nbsp; He was distinguished for his
extensive liberality to the poor and his interest in their
education.&nbsp; He was often seen going about from school to
school, and the kindliness of his heart was so well known to the
children that they sometimes pulled his coat behind to obtain his
benignant smile, which to them was like sunshine after
rain.&nbsp; On all occasions he was earnest in his advocacy of
civil and religious liberty, and active in his exertions on
behalf of all benevolent associations, both of the Church and of
Dissenters.&nbsp; He was also a promoter <a
name="page523"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 523</span>of all
literary institutions in the city and elsewhere, and often
attended their anniversaries at which he delivered animated
addresses.&nbsp; He did not lay claim to the character of a man
of science; but astronomy, geology, botany, and natural history
were his favourite studies.&nbsp; He was the author of two
interesting volumes on &ldquo;The History of Birds,&rdquo; which
were published by the Society for the Promotion of Christian
Knowledge.&nbsp; He was elected president of the Linn&aelig;an
Society, and he accepted an appointment as one of the
commissioners chosen to inquire into the state of the British
Museum.</p>
<p>Bishop Stanley was so little of a bigot that he appeared once
on the same platform with Father Mathew, a Roman Catholic, at a
temperance meeting in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; He then and
there eulogised the apostle of temperance, and advocated the
cause with great eloquence.&nbsp; On another occasion he invited
Jenny Lind, now Madame Goldscmidt, to the palace, when she
visited this city.&nbsp; At the palace one evening, she sang
before a large company.&nbsp; When it became known that the lord
bishop of the diocese had actually entertained an operatic
singer, great was the indignation of some of the clergy.&nbsp;
This however did not at all distress the good bishop, who held on
the even tenor of his way, doing good whenever he had an
opportunity.&nbsp; By his frequent earnest discourses in many
churches in this diocese, he caused quite a revival of religion
among the clergy and church-going people.&nbsp; He died, much
lamented, on September 6th, 1849, in the 70th year of his age,
and he was buried <a name="page524"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
524</span>in the middle of the nave of the Cathedral, in the
presence of thousands who had known and loved him.&nbsp; A short
time after his decease, a slab to his memory was laid over his
grave, bearing the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">In the love of Christ<br />
Here rests from his labours<br />

<h4><i>Bishop Hinds</i>.</h4>
<p>Samuel Hinds, D.D., succeeded Bishop Stanley.&nbsp; He was the
sixty-seventh bishop of the diocese, and was installed on January
24th, 1850.&nbsp; He was the son of Abel and Elizabeth Thornhill
Hinds, born Dec. <a name="page525"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
525</span>23rd, 1793, in Barbadoes; and at the age of twelve he
was sent to England, to the school of Mr. Phillips, at Frenchay,
near Bristol.&nbsp; He entered at Baliol College, Oxford, but for
want of rooms removed to Queen&rsquo;s, graduated in honours 1815
(second in classics), and in the year following he obtained the
Latin essay.&nbsp; He returned to Barbadoes as a missionary and
remained there five years, the three latter as vice-principal of
Codrington College.&nbsp; After he returned to England he became
vice-principal of Alban Hall, Oxford; and he accompanied
Archbishop Whately to Ireland, as his private chaplain.&nbsp; He
was subsequently presented with the living of Yardley, in Herts.,
by Dr. Coplestone, bishop of Llandaff.&nbsp; Dr. Hinds again
returned to Ireland, having been preferred to the living of
Castlenock by Archbishop Whateley, and was chosen private
chaplain to Lord Clarendon, lord lieutenant of Ireland.&nbsp;
Hence he removed to the deanery of Carlisle, but was scarcely
settled there when he was appointed to the bishopric of
Norwich.&nbsp; He had previously refused the bishoprics of New
Zealand and Cork.&nbsp; He laboured in this diocese for seven
years, often preaching in the churches, attending religious
meetings, and delivering addresses of a high character.&nbsp; He
generally preached at the anniversaries of the Church
Associations in this city.&nbsp; He resigned the see of Norwich
in April, 1857, and retired into private life.&nbsp; His health
is said to have been impaired by his arduous labours in
conducting the Oxford commissions which the government had
entrusted to him, and which, added to his <a
name="page526"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 526</span>duties in
the diocese and the office of chaplain to the house of lords,
proved too much for his constitution.&nbsp; Dr. Hinds is perhaps
the most learned of modern bishops.&nbsp; His literary talents
are considerable.&nbsp; He is the author of the &ldquo;Rise and
Progress of Christianity,&rdquo; first published in the
&ldquo;Enclyclop&aelig;dia Metropolitana,&rdquo; and considered a
standard work, highly esteemed for its comprehensive views of
religious truth.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Three Temples of the One
God;&rdquo; &ldquo;Catechists&rsquo; Manual;&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Inspirations of the Scriptures,&rdquo; are works from his
pen, which testify to his deep learning and great research.&nbsp;
He is the author of many beautiful poems and hymns, some of which
are familiar to the congregation at Norwich Cathedral, from being
repeated in the service as arranged to music.&nbsp; The
confirmation hymn is simple and appropriate.</p>
<h4><i>Mr. William Dalrymple</i>.</h4>
<p>In a brief history of the <i>Norfolk and Norwich Hospital</i>,
published by Dr. Copeman, we find the following memoir of the
subject of this notice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Dalrymple was a native of Norwich, his
father having removed thither from Scotland.&nbsp; He was born in
1772, and at an early age was sent to the Grammar School at
Aylsham, in Norfolk, from whence he was removed to the Free
School at Norwich, where he became a favourite pupil of its then
head master, the celebrated Dr. Parr.&nbsp; Here he had for a
schoolfellow Dr. Maltby, and with both, Dr. Parr kept up a
friendly intercourse of visits to the latest period of <a
name="page527"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 527</span>his
life.&nbsp; It affords a strong proof of Mr. Dalrymple&rsquo;s
early talents and his industry in cultivating them, that,
although in accordance with the then custom of requiring medical
apprenticeship to extend to seven years, he was obliged to leave
school at the age of fourteen, he had yet attained such a
proficiency in classical reading, and so correct an appreciation
of its beauties, that, amidst all the urgent and various
occupations and anxieties of his succeeding life, he found the
greatest relief to his toils in a recurrence to his favourite
authors.&nbsp; His taste was scholarlike as well as scientific;
his conversation embued with classical allusion, and his felicity
in quotation remarkable. <a name="citation527"></a><a
href="#footnote527" class="citation">[527]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dalrymple was apprenticed in London, and studied at
Guy&rsquo;s and St. Thomas&rsquo; Hospitals under Cline and Sir
Astley Cooper.&nbsp; He returned to Norwich in 1793, and opened a
surgery in his father&rsquo;s house; and although for several
years his progress in establishing a practice was slow, he at
last attained the highest reputation as a surgeon in his native
city, and for many years enjoyed the confidence, friendship, and
patronage of a very large number of patients of every grade of
society and in every district of the county.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1812 Mr. Dalrymple was elected assistant surgeon to
the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, and two years afterwards
succeeded to the full surgeoncy, a post which he occupied with
great credit to himself and benefit to his profession until 1839,
a period of twenty-five years.&nbsp; He was then in the 67th year
of his age, his powers were less vigorous, and finding himself no
longer equal to his hospital practice, he resigned his position
there, receiving a cordial acknowledgment from the governors, of
&lsquo;the able, humane, and successful exercise of his official
duties,&rsquo; and being honoured by a request to accept the
appointment of honorary consulting <a name="page528"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 528</span>surgeon.&nbsp; In 1844 Mr. Dalrymple
finally retired from professional life, and died in London on the
5th of December, 1848, aged 75 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the year 1831 to 1835, I had ample opportunities,
as house surgeon of the hospital, of observing, and profiting by,
the mode in which the late Mr. Dalrymple performed his public
professional duties in that institution; and remember with
pleasure and satisfaction, that I was sometimes able to render
assistance, and save trouble, to one so deserving of the
gratitude and goodwill of those with whom he had to do.&nbsp; At
the period referred to, Mr. Dalrymple was beginning to feel the
burden of heavy surgical responsibilities more weighty than his
somewhat feeble frame would bear; his naturally acute sensibility
was increased by a measure of debility resulting from overmuch
professional occupation.&nbsp; The sudden call to perform a
serious and difficult operation was accompanied sometimes with a
degree of shock to his nerves, which told upon him injuriously;
and the desire he had to save the life of the sufferer submitted
to his charge (always a predominant feeling in his mind,) would
well-nigh overpower him with emotion.&nbsp; I have often heard
him say that he was not able to sleep the night before he had to
perform the operation of lithotomy, although in such cases his
success was great; but he possessed so much sympathy for his
patient, and felt his own responsibility so strongly, that he
failed to secure to his mind that rest which alone could have
enabled him to meet the contingencies of his profession with
composure.&nbsp; This nervous sensibility was due in part to
original constitution, and increased by professional toil.&nbsp;
Sometimes it arises from defective knowledge, or from want of
success; but so far from either being the case with Mr.
Dalrymple, his knowledge was ample, the result of many
years&rsquo; industrious application of a mind capable of vast <a
name="page529"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
529</span>acquirements&mdash;sufficient to have given him
confidence in the treatment of any case submitted to his care;
his success was beyond that of many placed in similar
circumstances; such, indeed, as might fairly have been expected
from one who had so much sympathy for suffering humanity, and who
devoted the whole energy of his mind to devise means to relieve
it.&nbsp; For a long period no one but himself, perhaps, was
aware of the stress upon his feelings which his professional
duties, so well performed, were wont to occasion; and when it did
become apparent to others, it was delightful to witness how
pleased, how grateful, how kind in expression he was for any
attention, encouragement, or assistance offered him; and how
highly he estimated the friendship of those who watched an
opportunity to perform those little offices of kindness and
consideration, which, although difficult to be defined, can
always be appreciated by a sensitive mind and a feeling
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The experience of a long and active professional life
endued Mr. Dalrymple with the valuable qualification of forming a
right judgment in cases of a complex and difficult nature, which
was fully appreciated and acknowledged.&nbsp; The firmness and
decision of his opinion upon a difficult case, when once formed,
could not fail to impress the practitioner by whom he was
consulted with confidence, and his patient with the assurance
that dependence might be placed upon the result of his
deliberations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one who had the privilege of Mr. Dalrymple&rsquo;s
acquaintance can think of him otherwise than as a kind friend, a
highly intelligent and well-informed man, an amusing and
instructive companion, and a profoundly gifted practitioner of
the art and science it was the business and happiness of his life
to pursue.&rdquo;</p>

<h4><a name="page530"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
530</span><i>Mr. John Greene Crosse</i>.</h4>
<p>We make the following extracts from a memoir of Mr. Crosse
published in Dr. Copeman&rsquo;s <i>History of the Norfolk and
Norwich Hospital</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;John Greene Crosse was the second son of
Mr. William Crosse, of Finborough, in Suffolk, and was born on
the 6th of September, 1790.&nbsp; In order to make known some
particulars of his early life and education, I cannot do better
than quote his own journal, which contains many remarks upon the
subject evidently intended to have formed part of a history of
his life.&nbsp; In April, 1819, he penned the following
observations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never went to boarding school, which
contributed, with many other occurrences of my subsequent life,
to fix me in the unsocial habits that hitherto never did and
never will forsake me.&nbsp; In my early years, no classical
learning, not a line of Latin, was taught at the proximate market
town to which I resorted as a daily pupil; and my first lessons
of reading, arithmetic, and writing were received from a master
of whom I entertained the greatest horror, for the ferocity of
his conduct, the severe discipline by which he drove into us the
simplest rudimental knowledge.&nbsp; His stern brow, raucous
voice, and long cane, are now livelily depicted to my mind: how
much I owe to him, I am even now, with a long life in retrospect,
unable to tell; but I was glad when circumstances arose that
released me from his tutorage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very small matters, and such as we have no
control over, and call accidental because unable to trace the
chain of causes giving rise to them, influence our mortal
destinies.&nbsp; I had attained my 12th (?) year, under such
tremendous <a name="page531"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
531</span>instruction as is related, when a Welsh gentleman
making some mistake at college (not implicating his good
character, an <i>informality</i> I should call it) found it well
to rusticate; and taking with him his premature wife, sought a
living by opening a classical school in Stowmarket.&nbsp; I
became one of his early pupils; and but for this good, easy
man&rsquo;s settling in the town, should never have launched into
such studies as Latin and Greek; of which, it is true, I did not
learn much, nor very accurately.&nbsp; But he was, nevertheless,
a plodding, working man; an increasing family made him exert his
abilities to the utmost; and I got out of him all the instruction
I ever received as a school-boy in the learned languages.&nbsp;
When about fifteen years of age, returning from my daily school,
in a feat in jumping, I had the accident, I ought not perhaps to
say the misfortune, to break my leg.&nbsp; The respectable
village surgeon attended me: he was one of the old school; of
fine, soft, soothing manners, clean dressed, with powdered head;
rode slowly a very well-looking horse; in short, he was a
gentleman, and commanded the respect of every one when he entered
the house; he was also a skilful and kind surgeon.&nbsp; What
wonder that the idea should be awakened in my mind to be of the
medical profession! to be as great a man as he&mdash;the Village
Doctor! to whom every one bowed, and who could relieve pain and
cure injuries so quickly and skilfully.&nbsp; I had conceived an
object of ambition, and the idea never deserted me.&nbsp; I was
in a month upon my crutches, and soon recovered; a surgical case
fixed my future destinies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I persevered a few years longer at Latin, Greek,
French, and Euclid.&nbsp; My father was successful and able now
to place me out well; wished me to be a lawyer, and I was for a
time under the instruction of a gentleman of that
profession&mdash;attending bankruptcy meetings, and feasting at
<a name="page532"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 532</span>midnight
at the expense of the already distracted creditors.&nbsp; Those
were good times for lawyers.&nbsp; A learned chancellor, whom I
met on one such occasion, I well remember complimenting me on my
quickness in counting money; but all would not do, my mind was
prepossessed&mdash;I quitted the law to follow my inclination; I
made my own choice; it was a pledge to success.&nbsp; The surgeon
who cured my leg agreed to take me as his first and only pupil,
and I was accordingly articled in due form for five
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 27th of September, 1811, Mr. Crosse went to
London for the purpose of studying his profession in that
Metropolis, and was the following day introduced to Mr.,
afterwards Sir Charles Bell, whose pupil he became, with whom he
contracted a close intimacy, and of whose merits as a teacher and
man of science he always spoke in the highest terms of respect
and gratitude.&nbsp; In the following January, he entered to
Abernethy&rsquo;s Lectures; and in April, 1812, became a student
at St. George&rsquo;s Hospital, where his industrious habits and
intelligence attracted the particular attention and marked notice
of the medical officers of that noble institution.&nbsp; In the
following month, he entered as a pupil at the Lock Hospital; and
in the course of the year, officiated as House Surgeon during the
temporary absence of the gentleman who occupied that
situation.&nbsp; In the following winter session, commencing
October, 1812, he studied under Brodie, Bell, Brande, Clarke,
Home, and others; and remarks in his journal, &lsquo;very
industrious all this winter, sitting up constantly till past two
a.m.&rsquo;&nbsp; In March, 1813, he became a dresser to Sir
Everard Home at St. George&rsquo;s Hospital; attended Midwifery
under Dr. Clarke; and on the 16th of April, passed the College of
Surgeons in London.&nbsp; After a short holiday, he returned to
London <a name="page533"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
533</span>on the 13th of May, and attended the Eye Infirmary at
Charter-house Square.&nbsp; In June, he resigned his dressership
under Sir E. Home; became acquainted with the late Mr. Travers,
Abernethy, Sir W. Blizard, and Dr. Macartney, whom he agreed to
accompany to Dublin; and much of his spare time during this
summer was devoted to the study of German, a language he ever
after cultivated that he might enjoy the profundity and research
of the professional literature of that country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crosse left England for Dublin on the 2nd of
October, 1813, arriving there the following day.&nbsp; In
December he became Demonstrator of Anatomy under Dr. Macartney,
and remained there until October, 1814, when he returned to
London, having received a very handsome testimonial from the
numerous students of the school in which he taught, as to his
ability and energy in the capacity of their instructor in
anatomy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On quitting Dublin, Mr. Crosse returned to Suffolk, and
was afterwards introduced to the late Dr. Rigby of Norwich.&nbsp;
In December he went to Paris, where he remained until the end of
February, 1815, during which period he took French Lessons, wrote
his Diary in the French language, and availed himself of every
possible opportunity of increasing his professional
knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 29th of March, 1815, Mr. Crosse came to Norwich;
and after remaining one year in lodgings, took a house in St.
Giles&rsquo;, in which he resided for many years.&nbsp; He soon
after published his &ldquo;Sketches of the Medical Schools of
Paris,&rdquo; and showed, both by his writings and the
industrious pursuit of his professional avocation, that he was
destined to arrive at considerable eminence in the locality he
had chosen for the arena of his future life.&nbsp; On the 19th of
July, 1823, he was the successful candidate for the appointment
<a name="page534"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 534</span>of
Assistant Surgeon to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.&nbsp; So
great was his desire to become connected with the Hospital, and
so strong the competition in which he was engaged to obtain this
object, that his health gave way under the exertions he made to
succeed; and he was obliged to absent himself for a time, on
which occasion he took a trip to Holland, visiting Brighton on
his return.&nbsp; The result was favourable, and he returned to
Norwich in good health.&nbsp; On the death of Mr. Bond, in 1826,
he was elected full Surgeon to the Hospital, and thus attained
one of the greatest objects of his ambition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rapid rise and progress of Mr. Crosse&rsquo;s
reputation as a professional man, and the large extent of his
private practice, are too well known to require further notice;
but notwithstanding the unremitting exertions required to fulfil
his private engagements, he never allowed them to interfere with
his public duties; and the devotedness of his service to the
Norfolk and Norwich Hospital was remarkable.&nbsp; It may be
truly said that no private patient received more kindness, skill,
and attention at his hands, than did those who were placed under
his care in the wards of the Hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an operating surgeon, Mr. Crosse had but few
superiors, and not many equals.&nbsp; He was possessed of
considerable manual tact and dexterity, which, coupled with a
sound judgment as to the necessity for the performance of an
operation, stamped him as a surgeon of first-rate
attainments.&nbsp; In his early professional life he studied
anatomy with great assiduity, and his subsequent occupation as
Demonstrator of Anatomy at Dublin so impressed the subject upon
his memory, that the constitution and form of the human body were
always in his mind&rsquo;s eye; and thus he was rendered equal,
at all times and upon all occasions, to the serious emergencies
of surgery.&nbsp; In short, he obtained <a
name="page535"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 535</span>and held
for a long period the foremost rank in his profession in this
district; and such was the quality of his mind, that he would
probably have been pre-eminent in whatever locality it might have
fallen to his lot to be placed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1819, Mr. Crosse published <i>A History of the
Variolous Epidemic of Norwich</i>, which has been, and is even
now, quoted as an excellent standard work.&nbsp; In 1822 he
published <i>Memoirs of the Life of the late Dr. Rigby</i>,
prefixed to the valuable Essay which the Doctor had published
some years before <i>On Uterine H&aelig;morrhage</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1835, the Jacksonian Prize was awarded him for his
<i>Essay on the Formation</i>, <i>Constituents</i>, <i>and
Extraction of the Urinary Calculus</i>; and in the same year he
received, in consequence of this Essay, the Diploma of M.D. from
the University of Heidelberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From 1822 to the close of his life, Mr. Crosse
contributed many valuable Papers to different medical
periodicals, which are of deep interest to professional men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1836, Mr. Crosse was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Society&mdash;a distinction which marked him for eminence
throughout the whole civilized world.&nbsp; In 1845, the College
of St. Andrew conferred the Degree of M.D. upon him, and there is
scarcely a medical or surgical society in Europe of which he was
not a member, as well as being an honorary member of the most
eminent societies in Asia and America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the last year of Mr. Crosse&rsquo;s life (1850),
it became painfully evident to his friends that he was gradually
losing that vigour of mind and body which had so long
characterized him; and at the urgent solicitation of his medical
advisers, he was induced to leave home for a few weeks, when he
took the opportunity of consulting Sir B. Brodie and Dr. Watson
in London, and spent a short time with the late Dr. Mackness at
Hastings, of whose <a name="page536"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
536</span>kindness he afterwards spoke in the highest terms of
gratitude.&nbsp; On his return home, he endeavoured to resume his
professional and even his literary avocations; but although in a
degree benefited by his holiday, he gradually lost power, and it
was clear that his race was almost run.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He died in his 60th year, having been a resident in Norwich 35
years.</p>
<h4><i>Dr. Hooker</i>.</h4>
<p>Norwich and Norfolk have produced an array of distinguished
botanists, such as Smith, Turner, Lindley, and the elder
Hooker.&nbsp; The president of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, Dr. Joseph D. Hooker, F.R.S., is the son
of Sir William J. Hooker, formerly Director of the Royal Gardens
at Kew, and he succeeded his father in that very important post
on November 12th, 1865.&nbsp; The present director of Kew sprung
from a race of botanists.&nbsp; His paternal grandfather, a
citizen of Norwich, devoted his leisure to the cultivation of
curious plants.&nbsp; This circumstance, doubtless, helped to
create that taste for botany which, in the career of his
illustrious father, has borne such ripe fruits.&nbsp; On the
maternal side, the grandfather of Dr. Hooker was Mr. Dawson
Turner, of Yarmouth.&nbsp; The eldest daughter of this gentleman
became the wife of Sir William J. Hooker in 1814.&nbsp; Mr.
Turner&rsquo;s is a well-known name in the annals of British
botany; he is the author of various botanical publications, and
it was at his suggestion that a narrative of a visit made to
Iceland in 1809 by his <a name="page537"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 537</span>future son-in-law was given to the
world, a work which brought the name of Sir William J. Hooker
prominently before the scientific world.&nbsp; So descended Dr.
Joseph D. Hooker was born at Halesworth, in Suffolk, on June
30th, 1817.&nbsp; Although thus by birth a native of Suffolk, he
is by descent a Norwich man.&nbsp; He has been a great botanical
traveller in many parts of the world, and he has added greatly to
our knowledge of the plants of Asia and India.&nbsp; On August
19th, 1868, as President of the British Association, when the
meeting took place in Norwich, he delivered the Inaugural Address
in the Drill Hall before a large audience.</p>
<h4><i>Mrs. Opie</i>.</h4>
<p>Amelia Opie was the daughter of Dr. Alderson, a physician in
Norwich, and was born here in 1769.&nbsp; The varied
circumstances of her early life gave the bent to her after
career.&nbsp; In her girlhood she beguiled the solitude of her
father&rsquo;s summer house by composing songs and tragedies; on
her visits to London, the superior society into which the graces
of her person and the accomplishments of her mind introduced her,
served to stimulate her aspirations; and after her marriage, in
1798, to the painter, Mr. John Opie, she was encouraged by her
husband to become a candidate for literary fame.&nbsp;
Accordingly, in 1801, she published a novel, entitled <i>Father
and Daughter</i>.&nbsp; Although this tale showed no artistic
ability in dealing either with incidents or with characters, yet
it was the <a name="page538"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
538</span>production of a lively fancy and a feeling heart, and
speedily brought its author into notice.&nbsp; She was encouraged
to publish a volume of sweet and graceful poems in 1802, and to
persist in the kind of novel writing which she had commenced so
successfully.&nbsp; <i>Adelaide Mowbray</i> followed in 1804, and
<i>Simple Tales</i> in 1806.&nbsp; The death of her husband in
1807, and her return to Norwich, did not slacken her
industry.&nbsp; She published <i>Temper</i> in 1812, <i>Tales of
Real Life</i> in 1813, <i>Valentine&rsquo;s Eve</i> in 1816,
<i>Tales of the Heart</i> in 1818, and <i>Madeline</i> in
1822.&nbsp; At length, in 1825, her assumption of the tenets and
garb of the Society of Friends checked her literary ardour, and
changed her mode of life.&nbsp; Nothing afterwards proceeded from
her pen except a volume entitled <i>Detraction Displayed</i>, and
some contributions in prose and verse to various
periodicals.&nbsp; A good deal of her life was spent in
travelling and in the exercise of Christian benevolence.&nbsp;
When in this city she was often seen in the assize court, sitting
near the judge.&nbsp; She seemed to take a great deal of interest
in criminal cases.&nbsp; She died here in 1853.&nbsp; A life of
Mrs. Opie, by Miss C. L. Brightwell, was published in 1854.</p>
<h4><i>Dr. William Crotch</i>.</h4>
<p>The celebrated musician, William Crotch, was born in the
parish of St. George at Colegate in this city, July 5th,
1775.&nbsp; His genius for music may be supposed to have
commenced with his existence, as his parents did not remember any
period in which he did <a name="page539"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 539</span>not shew a great predilection for an
organ, to which instrument he seemed to have a special
attachment.&nbsp; Indeed he had a <i>penchant</i> for every
musical instrument at an early age.&nbsp; As soon as he could
walk alone, which was at the beginning of his second year, he
would frequently quit his mother&rsquo;s breast to hear a tune on
the organ, and when he wanted any particular tune, he would put
his finger upon that key on which the tune began; and as it
sometimes happened that more than one tune began on the same key,
he would strike two or three of the first or leading notes of the
tune he chose to have played.&nbsp; Before he was two years and a
quarter old, he played &ldquo;God save the King&rdquo; with both
hands.&nbsp; At two years and a half he had played to several
ladies and gentlemen, and was soon afterwards noticed in the
public journals.&nbsp; At two and three quarters he could
distinguish any note, and call it by its proper name, though he
did not see it struck.&nbsp; His memory was so retentive, that a
gentleman only playing to him the Minuet in <i>Rodelinda</i> two
or three times in the evening, was astonished to hear him perform
it next morning, as soon as he went to the organ.&nbsp; Before he
was three years old, he played at Beccles, Ipswich, and other
places.&nbsp; Afterwards he was taken to Lynn, Bury, &amp;c., and
in October, 1778, to Cambridge.&nbsp; In November, he was
nominated to a degree of Bachelor of Arts, with a small annuity
annexed to it.&nbsp; In December he went to London, and after
performing before the foreign ambassadors, maids of honour,
&amp;c., in 1779, he was introduced to the sovereign, to whom he
gave the greatest satisfaction, <a name="page540"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 540</span>as he had done to the nobility and
gentry in general, but more particularly to the greatest
musicians.&nbsp; At the early age of 22 he was appointed
professor of music in the University of Oxford, and there, in
1799, took his degree of doctor in that art.&nbsp; In 1800 and
the four following years, he read lectures on music at
Oxford.&nbsp; Next he was appointed lecturer on music at the
Royal Institution; and subsequently, in 1823, principal of the
Royal Academy of Music.&nbsp; He published a number of vocal and
instrumental compositions, of which the best is his oratorio of
&ldquo;Palestine.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1831 appeared an octavo volume,
containing the substance of his lectures on music, delivered at
Oxford and in London.&nbsp; He also published &ldquo;Elements of
Musical Composition and Thorough Bass.&rdquo;&nbsp; He arranged
for the piano-forte a number of Handel&rsquo;s oratorios and
operas, besides symphonies and quartetts of Haydn, Mozart, and
Beethoven.&nbsp; He performed all his public duties laboriously,
zealously, and honourably, and in private life he was much
beloved.&nbsp; He died on December 29th, 1847, in the house of
his son, at Taunton.</p>

541</span>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
Norwich Artists in the Nineteenth Century.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Norwich</span> artists must have
flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries, as proved by their
portraits of city worthies in the Guildhall and St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, but we have few notices of early painters or
engravers.&nbsp; About the commencement of the present century, a
gentleman named Thomas Harvey lived at Catton, and was recognised
as a very clever amateur artist.&nbsp; He painted in oil,
admirably, and he induced several of the leading artists of the
day to visit Norfolk, such as Opie, Gainsborough, Sir William
Beechey, Collins, and many others, who produced beautiful works
of art.</p>
<p>About the year 1802, a few professional and amateur artists,
drawn together by a similarity of taste and inclination, for the
advancement of the arts of painting and design in their native
city, began to associate to form a regular academy.&nbsp; Each
member in his turn furnished matter of discussion according with
his particular view; and by eliciting the opinions of his brother
artists, mutually communicated and received <a
name="page542"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
542</span>information.&nbsp; The first exhibition of this society
was in 1805, in Wrench&rsquo;s Court, and contained 223
pictures.&nbsp; The following is a list of the members and
exhibitors of the Norwich Society of Artists from the first
catalogue of 1805:&mdash;Arthur Browne, J. Blake, E. Bell,
(engraver) Mrs. Coppin, H. M. M. Crotch, M. B. Crotch, J. Crome,
R. Dixon, J. Freeman, W. Freeman, Rev. Wm. Gordon of Saxlingham,
C. Hodgson, W. Harwin, R. Ladbrooke, W. C Leeds, J. Percy, J.
Thirtle, F. Stone, architect.&nbsp; This Society of Artists,
after their establishment, within twenty years exhibited about
4000 pictures, the productions of 323 painters, very few of which
were sold here, but which were readily purchased in London and
other places.&nbsp; In fact, the local artists were very little
patronized in the city; and old Crome, one of the very best
landscape painters in England, was a very poor man all his life,
though, since his death, his pictures have been sold for
thousands of pounds in London.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">John Crome</span>, sen., was born December
21st, 1769, in the parish of St. Peter per Mountergate.&nbsp; He
was apprenticed to Mr. Francis Whisler, coach, house, and sign
painter, who, in 1783, lived in Bethel Street; but he felt the
true impulse of genius, and his industry surmounted all
obstacles.&nbsp; By almost unaided exertions he cultivated
drawing and painting in oil with such ardour and success, that
during the latter years of his life he had attained an eminence
highly creditable, and was incessantly employed as a master in
the one branch by families of distinction, and by <a
name="page543"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 543</span>the
principal schools of Norfolk and Norwich.&nbsp; He possessed the
rare faculty of communicating the ardour he himself felt to his
pupils, both professional and amateur.&nbsp; His mind was too
acute to exact from them a servile imitation of his own style; on
the contrary he contented himself with instilling the more useful
principles of art, and with giving freedom and spirit to their
pencils.&nbsp; He then invited them to let loose the reins of
fancy and taste, and to follow unfettered the promptings of
imagination.&nbsp; The fruits of this wise discrimination were
seen in the reputation of his son, and his companions in
excellence, whose works for some time attracted much attention in
the metropolis to the growing talents and promise of the Norwich
school of artists.&nbsp; In the other department he was seldom
without commissions.&nbsp; He principally cultivated landscape
painting, and he was exceedingly happy in seizing small
picturesque local scenes, which he elevated to a degree of
interest which they could hardly bear in their natural
state.&nbsp; He was in painting the counterpart of Burns in
poetry, both delighting in homely scenes.&nbsp; His pictures were
beginning to be known and appreciated in London, the great mart
of talent, and those he last exhibited in the British Gallery
gained him a lasting fame.&nbsp; He was a man of heart, of
impulse and feeling, quick, lively, and enthusiastic, and in his
conversation animated to a high degree, especially when speaking
on subjects connected with his art, the fond, the incessant, the
earliest and latest object of his thoughts.&nbsp; A wide field of
enterprise and exertion had just opened upon <a
name="page544"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 544</span>his view,
the last stage of his ardent ambition had unfolded itself, when
he was suddenly seized with an acute disease, which terminated
his life in the short space of seven days, on April 22nd, 1821,
aged fifty years.&nbsp; He was buried in a vault in St.
George&rsquo;s Colegate Church, where the last sad offices of
respect were paid to his memory by a numerous attendance of
artists and other friends.&nbsp; Of late years a subscription was
raised here for a monument to his memory, and after some delay a
suitable memorial was placed in the church.&nbsp; (<i>See
page</i> <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page89">89</a></span>.)</p>
<p>The following list of Mr. Crome&rsquo;s principal pictures,
with their former possessors, was extracted from the published
catalogue of his works:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lane Scene near Hingham,&rdquo; 1812; &ldquo;Lane Scene
at Blofield,&rdquo; 1813; and &ldquo;Grove Scene near
Marlingford,&rdquo; 1815&mdash;Samuel Paget, Esq., of

<p>&ldquo;Carrow Abbey,&rdquo; 1805&mdash;P. M. Martineau,
Esq.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cottage and Wood Scene,&rdquo; 1820&mdash;Michael
Bland, Esq., London.</p>
<p><a name="page545"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Crome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grove Scene,&rdquo; 1820&mdash;Mr. F. Geldart, jun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;View of the Italian Boulevards at Paris,&rdquo; 1815;
and &ldquo;Fish Market at Boulogne,&rdquo; 1820&mdash;R. H.
Gurney, Esq.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Wood Scene&rdquo; was the last picture painted by Old
Crome, in April, 1821.&nbsp; He painted many others, and etched a
number of plates of Norfolk scenery, some of which have been
printed.&nbsp; His pictures have been lent for various
exhibitions and always much admired.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>J. B. <span class="smcap">Crome</span>, son of the father of
the Norwich School of Landscape Painting, was a landscape painter
of moonlights, &amp;c.&nbsp; The editor of the <i>Examiner</i>
for March, 1828, speaking of this artist&rsquo;s pictures,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Crome&rsquo;s moonlight is good, and
has the grey and brown hues of Vanderneer, whose moonlight scenes
have been considered the best as to natural effects; but except
the parts under the immediate light of the moon, no specific
colour should be seen.&nbsp; The browns and yellows here mingle
well into the black shades of night, and have nothing of that
flat grey blue which justly made coloured moonlights to be
compared to a shilling on a slate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. J. B. Crome&rsquo;s pictures were &ldquo;Rouen,&rdquo; in
the possession of Mrs. Southwell, Wroxham; &ldquo;Yarmouth
Quay&rdquo;&mdash;T. Cobbold, Esq., Catton; &ldquo;Yarmouth
Beach, Moonlight&rdquo;&mdash;R. J. Turner, Esq., Catton;
&ldquo;View near Amsterdam, Moonlight&rdquo;&mdash;J. Geldart,
Esq., Norwich; &ldquo;Norwich by Moonlight&rdquo;&mdash;Hon.
General Walpole; &ldquo;Moonlight&rdquo;&mdash;C. Turner, Esq.,
Norwich.&nbsp; Several <a name="page546"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 546</span>others of this artist&rsquo;s
pictures were exhibited at the Norwich Industrial Exhibition in
1867, and were much admired.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Crome</span>, daughter of Old Crome,
was a painter of fruit and flowers from nature, and painted
successfully.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Clover</span> was a native of this
city, but he resided some time in London.&nbsp; His first efforts
in art were directed to engraving, and by the advice of a
gentleman named Stocks, he took an impression of one of his
plates to the late Alderman Boydell, in Cheapside, whose remarks
on this performance discouraged him from following the profession
of an engraver, and he remained for some time undetermined as to
his further pursuit in art, until the following autumn, when
being introduced by his uncle to the late Mr. Opie, whilst
painting a portrait of that relation, he was so astonished at the
facility with which the artist painted, and so delighted with his
conversation, that he resolved from that moment to be a
painter.&nbsp; He took Mr. Opie&rsquo;s advice and followed him
to town, from which period, namely, April, 1807, being nearly
four years, he enjoyed that artist&rsquo;s friendship.&nbsp; In
the year 1806, Mr. Clover was accidentally introduced to the late
Richard Cumberland, the dramatic poet, who perceiving that the
artist&rsquo;s health was much impaired by a too close
application to study, invited him to his house at Ramsgate, and
by his introduction he painted several portraits, and to <a
name="page547"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 547</span>the
hospitable residence of this gentleman he repeated his visits
during the summer months for fourteen years.&nbsp; In Norwich, he
painted three full-length portraits for St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall,
besides a number of others, and a picture called &ldquo;Divided
Attention,&rdquo; for his friend Mr. Turner, of Norwich.&nbsp;
This first-rate picture excited much interest in London.&nbsp;
Some of the early pictures of this artist were at Beau Port, the
house of the late Sir James Bland Burgess, and at Battle Abbey in
Sussex.&nbsp; Subsequently Mr. Clover had the honour of being
patronised by the Marquis of Stafford and other noblemen.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">William Robert Dixon</span> was a native
of this city.&nbsp; His etchings of views in Norfolk were in the
possession of many persons in Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. Charles Turner
had an interesting collection of his drawings.&nbsp; As a scene
painter he was much admired.&nbsp; He had many tempting offers
from the London and other managers of theatres; but being fondly
and firmly attached to his native city and a choice circle of
friends, no allurements could induce him to leave them.&nbsp; He
was very popular as a teacher of drawing.&nbsp; He died October
1st, 1815.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles Hodgson</span>, a native of this
city, was a painter of interior architecture, particularly of the
early English style, and of considerable reputation for his
excellent drawing and correct perspective in water colours, which
subjects he was afterwards induced to paint in oil, in which he
excelled.&nbsp; He <a name="page548"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
548</span>was a constant exhibitor in the London
exhibitions.&nbsp; His pictures were in the possession of several
gentlemen in the city and county.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">David Hodgson</span>, son of the above, a
native also of this city, was a painter of exterior architecture,
landscape, &amp;c.&nbsp; Some of his pictures of interiors of
churches were in the possession of William Herring, Esq.,
Norwich; Pair of Landscapes, W. Roberts, Esq., of Birmingham;
Large Landscape, Rev. J. Hollingworth, Newcastle; Small
Landscape, Wm. Gate, Esq., Carlisle; Market Scenes, T. Bignold,
Esq., Norwich; Landscape, Mr. S. Coleman; Pair of Small
Landscapes, Mr. Stone, Norwich; Tombland, Mr. Stone; Landscape,
Mr. G. Cooke, engraver; Pair of Street Scenes, Mr. Yarington,
Norwich; Market Scenes, sold at the Liverpool exhibition.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert Ladbrooke</span>, landscape
painter, for many years enjoyed considerable celebrity as a
drawing master, and in 1821 commenced the publication of &ldquo;A
Series of Views of the Churches in Norfolk,&rdquo; printed in
lithography, of which ninety numbers were completed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Stannard</span> was a marine
painter, in which walk of art he established a high
reputation.&nbsp; His subjects were generally finely chosen, and
painted with all the truth and transparency of nature.&nbsp; The
grouping of his vessels displayed an admirable taste, and they
were embellished with the most correctly-drawn <a
name="page549"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 549</span>figures,
highly characteristic of the stations they occupied.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Stannard</span>, wife of the above,
was a painter of fruit, flowers, fish, still life, &amp;c.&nbsp;
Her maiden name was Coppin, and her mother was rewarded by the
Society for the Encouragement of Arts, for several copies of
painting.&nbsp; The daughter&rsquo;s productions were highly
esteemed by the lovers of art.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Alfred Stannard</span>.&nbsp; The talents
of this artist, at an early period of his life, gained him the
approbation of the critics of the London Journals&mdash;which
noticed works of fine arts as exhibited in the National
Gallery.&nbsp; The <i>Literary Gazette</i> of March, 1828,
contained this notice,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No. 152, Trowse Hall, Norwich, painted on
the spot by A. Stannard.&nbsp; We think that this work partakes
more of the Flemish style of art than legitimately belongs to a
picture painted on the spot; its elaborate finish must
necessarily have required considerable time in the execution; and
the character of our climate is much too variable, day after day,
to paint from the same hue of atmosphere, and the same effect of
Chiaroscuro.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the excellence of the
performance, however it may have been achieved, is an abundantly
sufficient passport to regard of this artist&rsquo;s
picture.&nbsp; No. 431, Sluice Gate, on the river Wensum, shews
the close resemblance of character and execution between the
works of some of our artists and the best pictures of the Flemish
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The critic might have added that most of the people of Norwich
are of Flemish or Danish extraction, and <a
name="page550"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 550</span>that the
Norwich school of painting seems to have been derived from the
Flemish school.&nbsp; The subjects painted, and the style of
treatment are very similar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Stark</span> was articled to the
senior Crome for three years, from 1810 or 1811, at the
expiration of which time he went to London and drew at the Royal
Academy, which place he was obliged to leave from ill
health.&nbsp; The first picture which he exhibited at the British
Gallery, represented &ldquo;Boys Bathing,&rdquo; purchased by the
Bishop of Oxford.&nbsp; His other pictures were &ldquo;Flounder
Fishing,&rdquo; in the possession of Sir J. Grey Egleton, Bart.;
&ldquo;Penning the Flock,&rdquo; the Marquis of Stafford;
&ldquo;Lambeth,&rdquo; the Countess de Grey; &ldquo;Grove

of George Watson Taylor, Esq., M.P.; Mr. Davenport, M.P.; Charles
Savill Onley, Esq., M.P.; Onley Savill Onley, Esq.; &amp;c.,

<p>J. S. <span class="smcap">Cotman</span> became one of the most
celebrated artists in the Water Colour Society, and attained a
very high position in London, where he was appointed Drawing
Master at King&rsquo;s College; he published Views in Normandy,
and also a work on the Sepulchral Brasses of this locality.&nbsp;
His pictures have always commanded high prices.&nbsp; His two
sons also became eminent artists.</p>

<p><a name="page551"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 551</span>About
the year 1830, there was something like a School of Art commenced
in Norwich, where artists and amateurs could study art in a
proper manner, from the best casts of the finest statues.&nbsp;
Before then, artists had to study as they best could, and their
education was very imperfect.&nbsp; They are much indebted to
John Barwell, Esq., for promoting their interests in this
respect, and rendering them great assistance by his knowledge of
art.&nbsp; Amongst the members of the new society were the
Barwells, father and son, the Cotmans, the Freemans, T. Geldart,
A. Sandys, S. Miers, and many others who studied art either from
the cast or the life.</p>
<p>The Norfolk and Norwich Art Union opened their exhibition of
pictures on August 16th, 1839, at the Bazaar, in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Broad Street.&nbsp; About 400 pictures were
exhibited, many of them being of a high order of merit.&nbsp; At
subsequent exhibitions, many pictures of local artists were
exhibited, including some of the Cromes, the Ladbrookes, the
Stannards, the Cotmans, Hodgson, Stark, Vincent, Downes, Sandys,
Capt. Roberts, and others much admired.&nbsp; A Fine Art
Association has also been recently established.&nbsp; It held its
first exhibition in August, 1868.&nbsp; A large number of the
pictures were disposed of on the principle of an Art Union.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
The Commercial History of Norwich.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">What</span> has been the trade of the
city, from the earliest period up to the present time, is an
interesting subject of inquiry to the inhabitants.&nbsp; The
sources of information are very scanty, for local historians of
former days did not trouble themselves much about trade, but were
content with simply recording passing events and the proceedings
of public bodies.&nbsp; From old charters and acts of parliament,
and details of local taxation, we may, however, learn something
about the industry and trade of by gone ages.&nbsp; We may
discover how people lived, how they were employed, and what sort
of clothes they wore; and we shall find a remarkable sameness
from age to age.&nbsp; The trade of any country, or county, or
town, arises from productive industry in agriculture <a
name="page553"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 553</span>or
manufactures, or in mercantile business, or in carrying goods
from one place to another, or in all three combined.&nbsp; All
three have existed in this city and county; and it is important
to inquire into the past and present state of our trade, and the
causes which have promoted or retarded its progress or
decline.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Textile Fabrics</span>.</h4>
<p>In tracing the rise and progress of manufactures in this city,
it will be necessary to refer to many sources of information
respecting the garments worn by the people of every period.&nbsp;
The Roman writers supply some information relating to the Iceni
and other aborigines of this island; the Anglo-Saxon
illuminations represent the costumes of a later period;
monumental effigies exhibit the clothing of the middle ages; and
many acts of parliament allude to the manufactures of modern
times.&nbsp; The arts of spinning, weaving, dyeing, and dressing
wool, linen, and silk, were known to all ancient civilized
nations.&nbsp; The Gauls taught those arts to the ancient Britons
in this island.&nbsp; Of the kinds of cloth made in Gaul,
according to Pliny, one was made of fine wool dyed in several
colours.&nbsp; This wool, being spun into yarn, was woven in
stripes or checquers, of which the Gauls made their summer
garments.&nbsp; Here we have the origin of the Scotch plaid or
tartan, which is called the garb of old Gaul to this day.</p>
<p>The dress of the ancient British females may be ascertained
from the account by Dion Cassius of the <a
name="page554"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 554</span>appearance
of Boadicea, Queen of the Iceni, who inhabited this eastern
district.&nbsp; Her light hair fell upon her shoulders.&nbsp; She
wore a torque of gold, a tunic of several colours all in folds,
and over it a robe of coarse stuff, fastened by a brooch.&nbsp;
The commonalty and the less civilized tribes, inhabiting the
interior of the island, went about simply clad in skins.&nbsp;
The Druids wore white dresses, and the Bards a robe of sky blue,
emblematic of peace.&nbsp; The Ovates, professing to know
medicine, wore green, the symbol of learning.&nbsp; Julius
Agricola being appointed to the command in Britain, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 78, soon succeeded in establishing
the Roman sway, and introducing the Roman costume, manners, and
language; and before the close of the first century the British
habit was regarded as a badge of barbarism.&nbsp; Tacitus says,
&ldquo;The sons of the British chiefs began to affect our
dress.&rdquo;&nbsp; The southern and eastern Britons disused the
Broccoe, and wore the Roman tunic reaching to the knee, with the
cloak or mantle.&nbsp; The female garb was similar to that of the
Roman women, who wore two tunics.</p>
<p>The Anglo Saxons, Jutes, and Danes, when located in different
parts of England, spun and wove most of the materials now used
for dress.&nbsp; The woollen, linen, and silk yarns were all
home-spun, and the textile fabrics were home-made.&nbsp; The
civil costume consisted of a linen shirt, a tunic of linen or
woollen, worn according to the season, descending to the knee,
and having long loose sleeves.&nbsp; It was made like the shirt,
and open at the neck, and put on in the same manner.&nbsp; <a
name="page555"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 555</span>It was
sometimes open at the sides and confined by a belt or girdle at
the waist.&nbsp; Over this a short cloak was worn fastened with
brooches, sometimes at the breast, sometimes on both
shoulders.</p>
<p>Mr. Strutt remarks that the silence of the Anglo-Saxon writers
on the subject of Danish dress, while they are profuse in the
description of the dress of their countrymen, proves a similarity
of costume.&nbsp; According to Danish ballads, black was the
colour of the ancient Danish dress.&nbsp; Saxon chronicles allude
to the Danes by the name of the &ldquo;Black Army.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Black amongst them had no funeral associations.&nbsp; This sombre
hue may have been their national colour, their standard being a
raven.&nbsp; After becoming settled in Norwich and Norfolk, they
doffed the black colour, and became effeminately gay in their
dress, and often changed their attire.</p>
<p>The Normans and Flemings who came over with the Conqueror into
England, and those who followed him in great numbers, were
remarkable for their love of finery, according to our early
historians.&nbsp; The dresses of the common people of course
continued to be much the same from age to age, but the habits of
the nobility were more influenced by fashion; and the reign of
William Rufus is stigmatised by many writers of the period for
shameful abuses.&nbsp; The king himself set the example, and the
clergy and laity were alike infected with the love of costly
clothing.&nbsp; After the Norman Conquest, a sort of cloth was
introduced which, though not a new discovery, had not been
formerly known in England.&nbsp; This was quite a <a
name="page556"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 556</span>different
article to what had been previously called cloth, the preparation
being by a combing instead of a carding process.&nbsp; By the
former the wool was drawn out to a very long staple, by the
latter to a very short staple, the fibres of the fleece being
extended the whole length in one instance, and broken and
intersected in the other.&nbsp; For 1000 years after the
christian era there were no textile manufactures as we now
understand the terms.&nbsp; All the yarns were homespun, and all
the garments were home-made.</p>
<p>The female costume in Norwich and other towns, from 1087 to
1154, presents us with but one striking novelty, and that by no
means an improvement.&nbsp; The rage for lengthening every
portion of the dress was not confined to the male sex.&nbsp; The
sleeves of the ladies&rsquo; tunics, and their veils or
kerchiefs, appear to have been so long in the reigns of William
Rufus and Henry I. as to be tied up in knots, to avoid treading
on them, and the trains or skirts of the garments lay in immense
rolls at the feet.&nbsp; Over the long robe or tunic a shorter
garment was occasionally seen in the illuminations of the
period.</p>
<p>The twelfth century is a period in which Norwich began to be
particularly mentioned for its trade arising from
manufactures.&nbsp; It is also a period when a very valuable
source of information is opened by the monumental effigies of the
dead, sculptured in their habits as they lived.&nbsp; The
effigies on brass are numerous in Norwich and Norfolk churches,
and indicate progress in useful arts.&nbsp; Mr. Stothard is a
great authority on the monumental effigies of Great Britain, <a
name="page557"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 557</span>and he
presents the coronation robes of the kings, and the costumes of
the nobles with splendid decorations.</p>
<p>The Dutch and the Flemings soon came over the sea, located
themselves in the city and in different parts of the eastern
counties, and introduced various manufactures.&nbsp; William of
Malmesbury states that in the reign of the Conqueror&rsquo;s
youngest son, Henry I., a great inundation in the low countries
drove many more of the Flemings to seek refuge in England; and
Blomefield, in his History of Norfolk, says that several of them
settled at Worstead in Norfolk, and thus early introduced the art
of stuff weaving there; which, as is natural to suppose, soon
began to be extensively adopted in Norwich.&nbsp; Gervase, of
Tilbury, writing of the Flemings says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The art of weaving seemed to be a peculiar
gift bestowed upon them by nature; yet the new comers were not
always well received by the native population, and had to be
protected by laws made in their favour.&nbsp; Indeed, the natives
of Norwich, in every period, have been hostile to foreigners, or
to any sort of interference with their peculiar branch of
industry.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next reign, that of Henry II., &ldquo;Guilds&rdquo; of
weavers were multiplied, and had their charters of privilege in
London, York, Winchester, and Norwich; and a system of
protection, originating with manufacturers, prevailed all over
the country.&nbsp; During the next reign, that of Stephen, more
Flemish weavers came over; and these successive emigrations were
a real blessing to the land.&nbsp; England had hitherto not been
a manufacturing country till the arrival of the <a
name="page558"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 558</span>Flemings,
who introduced the preparation and weaving of wool, so that, in
process of time, not only the home market was abundantly supplied
with woollen cloth, but a large surplus was made for
exportation.&nbsp; The Flemings were kinsmen of the Danes, and
all of them were of the Anglo-Saxon race, and were distinguished
for that probity in their dealings which afterwards became the
characteristic of British merchants.</p>
<p>During the reign of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion, it is supposed
that though the trade of the kingdom did not increase, yet some
of the artisan soldiers who returned from the crusades brought
back a knowledge of the eastern method of weaving.&nbsp; At that
time the useful arts flourished in the east.&nbsp; The
improvements introduced here were, however, of little worth,
owing to the troubles of the reign of King John, and the equally
disturbed reign of his son Henry III.&nbsp; Even the wise and
resolute king, Edward I., did not fully succeed in restoring
English trade to its former prosperity.&nbsp; Yet it is clear
that this city had been all along prospering, for in the reign of
Edward II., repeated mention is made of its thrift.&nbsp; That
monarch granted a patent to John Peacock for measuring every
piece of worsted made in the city or county; but this, being
found to check the trade, was soon recalled.&nbsp; In the reign
of Edward I. the people of Norwich, and of England generally,
began to adopt the whimsical fashions of their neighbours on the
continent.&nbsp; Horned head-dresses of frightful appearance were
worn by the ladies, and tight-laced stays.&nbsp; Gauze, which is
thought to have derived its name from Gaza, where <a
name="page559"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 559</span>it was
first made, and brunetta or burnetta, with several other fine and
delicate stuffs, are mentioned in this period.&nbsp; Gauzes were
afterwards produced in large quantities in Norwich.&nbsp; Tartan
was a fine woollen cloth, which was also much used for
ladies&rsquo; robes, and was generally of a scarlet dye.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth century the materials for dress became more
numerous, and this period is more remarkable for the splendour of
costume than for change of form.&nbsp; Matthew Paris, monk of St.
Albany, a contemporary historian, describes the pageantry of the
day, and expresses disgust rather than pleasure at the excessive
foppery of the times.&nbsp; He states that the nobility who
attended at the marriage of the daughter of Henry III. to
Alexander king of Scotland, were attired in vestments of silk,
commonly called comtises, on the day when the ceremony was
performed, but on the following day they were laid aside.</p>
<p>In the reign of Edward III. other foreign clothiers came to
England, and many of them settled in the eastern parts of
Essex.&nbsp; In 1353, this monarch prohibited his subjects from
wearing any cloth but such as was made in this kingdom; and he
also forbade the exportation of wool.&nbsp; Both in this reign
and in that of Richard II., repeated mention occurs in the oath
book and court rolls of wool-combers, card makers, clothiers,
weavers, fullers, &amp;c.&nbsp; During the reign of Elizabeth a
new impulse was given to the trade by the emigration of
Protestants and others from the low countries, and from France,
who introduced important branches of industry.&nbsp; Mr. James,
in <a name="page560"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 560</span>his
History of the Worsted Manufacture in England, says, that king
Edward III. so far extended and improved that trade, that from
his reign may be dated a new era in its history.&nbsp; This
monarch could not, with all his sagacity, and the earnest desire
he ever evinced for the welfare and prosperity of his subjects,
remain long unmindful of the great profit and advantage of
working up the English wool for domestic consumption or export,
instead of exporting the material in a raw state.&nbsp; When,
therefore, he espoused Phillippa, the daughter of the Earl of
Hainault, whose subjects were excellent cloth makers, the close
connection which the marriage occasioned between the two
countries, and probably in part some suggestions of the queen,
induced the king, in 1331, to invite hither a large number of his
countrymen, skilful in the art of weaving woollen and
worsted.&nbsp; These Flemish weavers settled, by the directions
of the king, and under his special protection, in various parts
of the country, where the wool grown in the district was suitable
for the particular kind of cloth made by these artizans.&nbsp;
The worsted weavers were located in Norfolk and Suffolk, having
Norwich for their chief seat or mart.&nbsp; Blomefield, in his
history, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Under the reign of Edward III., Norwich
became the most flourishing city of all England by means of its
great trade in worsted, fustian, friezes, and other woollen
manufactures, for now the English wool, being manufactured by
English hands, incredible profit accrued to the people by its
passing through and employing so many, every one having a fleece,
sorters, combers, card spinners, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page561"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
561</span>Alluding to the condition of this trade at the same
period, old Fuller, in his Church History, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The intercourse being large betwixt the
English and the Netherlands, (which having increased since King
Edward married the daughter) unsuspected emissaries were employed
by our king with those countries, who brought them into
familiarity with such Dutchmen as were absolute masters of their
trade, (but not masters themselves) as either journeymen or
apprentices.&nbsp; These bemoaned the slavishness of their poor
servants, whom their masters used rather like heathen than
christians; yea, rather, like horses than men; early up and late
to bed, and all day hard work, and harder fare, (a few herrings
and mouldy cheese,) and all to enrich the churls their masters,
without any profit unto themselves.&nbsp; But, oh, how happy
should they be if they would but come over to England! bringing
their mystery with them, which would provide their welcome in all
places.&nbsp; Here they should feed on fat beef and mutton till
nothing but their fulness should stint their stomach; yea, they
should feed on the labour of their own hands, enjoying a
proportionable portion of their gains for themselves.&nbsp;
Persuaded with the promises, many Dutch servants leave their
masters and come over to England.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Blomefield, the trade continued to increase
during the succeeding reign, that of Richard II., when laws were
passed for regulating the sale of worsted.&nbsp; Our ancestors
were then a plain homely sort of people, and like their
forefathers, were content with coarse woollen cloths for their
plain clothes.&nbsp; In this and succeeding reigns important
changes took place in the system of society, especially in the
formation <a name="page562"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
562</span>of a middle class, which gradually increased in numbers
and influence, and became the great support of trade.&nbsp;
Norman despotism was relaxed, and political liberty was advanced,
and the darkness of the middle ages was dispelled.</p>
<p>In <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1403, Henry IV.
separated the city of Norwich from the county of Norfolk, and
made it a county of itself, which it has been ever since.&nbsp;
This, of course, has been a great advantage to the city as
regards its self-government.&nbsp; In this reign it was deemed
necessary to appoint officers, whose business it should be to
inspect the goods; and in the reigns of Henry V., Henry VI.,
Edward IV., and Richard III., complaints were renewed in acts of
parliament and other documents of the great &ldquo;crafte and
deceite&rdquo; used in the making of worsteds, says, serges,
fustians, motleys, &amp;c., at Norwich.</p>
<p>During the short reign of Edward VI., the making of
&ldquo;felt and thrummed hats, dornecks, and coverlets,&rdquo;
had sprung up in consequence of the decline of the old stuff
manufacture; and in the reign of Mary the manufacture of
&ldquo;light stuffs&rdquo; was introduced.&nbsp; These were of
the same fabric as &ldquo;the fustians of Naples,&rdquo; and seem
to have been so similar to the bombazines of succeeding years,
that they may be considered as the commencement of the great
staple of Norwich.&nbsp; During the subsequent reigns the city
does not seem to have advanced in prosperity.&nbsp; Henry VII.
succeeded in reviving the trade a little, but in the reign of his
son, Henry VIII., it again declined.&nbsp; We find by an <a
name="page563"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 563</span>act passed
in that reign &ldquo;that the making of worsteds, says, and
stammins, which had greatly increased in the city of Norwich and
county of Norfolk, was now practised more diligently than in
times past at Yarmouth and Lynn.&rdquo;&nbsp; If so, the trade
soon died out in those towns, as we have no record of any
manufactures there.</p>
<p>Philip and Mary passed an act to encourage the making
&ldquo;of russels, satins, satins-reverses, and fustians of
Naples.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this time it appears that the stuffs
made in the city were exported into foreign countries, most
probably into Holland and Flanders, and at length partial
restrictions were laid on the export trades, but still a great
amount of business was done.&nbsp; As yet no one had promulgated
the modern doctrines of free trade.</p>
<p>From Cotman&rsquo;s valuable work, &ldquo;The Sepulchral
Brasses of Norfolk,&rdquo; we may gather some information
respecting the costumes of people in the middle ages.&nbsp; With
reference to the dresses of the ladies, we may be surprised at
the tardy progress of &ldquo;fashion&rdquo; in medi&aelig;val
times, but a little consideration will enable us to solve the
difficulty.&nbsp; In the fifteenth century money was very scarce,
and all the articles of female apparel were about twelve times
more costly than they are at present.&nbsp; Husbands and fathers
were doubtless &ldquo;intractable&rdquo; in proportion.&nbsp;
Hence our fair but thrifty ancestresses continued to wear the
very same dresses on all festive occasions for many years.&nbsp;
Now, however, the facilities of foreign travel, the introduction
of cheaper materials, the results of modern <a
name="page564"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 564</span>ingenuity,
and the spirit of the age in which we live, all tend to rapid,
frequent, and capricious changes of costume; but it was not so
then, and a lady was frequently attired as her grandmother had
been before her!&nbsp; Our ancestors were slow coaches.&nbsp;
Centuries elapsed before they achieved the <i>ruff</i>, before
they discovered the <i>bonnet</i>, before they perpetrated the
<i>wig</i>!&nbsp; They never dreamt of <i>crinoline</i>.&nbsp;
Thus, for example, we observe the very same form of kirtle or
gown&mdash;close fitting, low waisted, but wide and pleated at
the bottom, during a period of more than 300 years, there being
only a slight variation in the shape of its sleeves.&nbsp; The
fall, the flounce, and cuffs of fur or some other material, must
have been also a very long-lived fashion, being observable on
many brasses from the dates of 1466 to 1537.&nbsp; But the
designers of brasses may have adhered for a long time to merely
conventional forms.&nbsp; The Rev. R. Hart, in his Letters to a
local magazine, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The wife of Sir Miles Stapleton, in 1365,
wears a close-fitting tunic over the kirtle, (the sleeves of
which, with a row of small buttons extending from the wrist to
the elbow, are seen underneath;) the sleeves of the tunic itself
are short, but there are oblong narrow pendants almost reaching
from them to the ground.&nbsp; It is buttoned at the breast,
there are two pockets in the front, and the lower part is full
and gathered into puckers or folds.&nbsp; (Cotman pl. 4).&nbsp;
During the reigns of Henry IV. and V. the ladies wore a sort of
bag sleeve, tight at the wrist (like that of a modern
bishop).&nbsp; About 1481, the sleeve became wide and open like
that of a surplice.&nbsp; About 1528, the sleeves of the kirtle,
or under <a name="page565"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
565</span>dress, were, in some instances, cut or pinked, so as to
exhibit a rich inner lining.&nbsp; In 1559, there was a tight
sleeve ruffled at the wrist, and with an epaulet upon the
shoulder, pinked; and at the same period we observe the earliest
specimen of the ruff, and the rudiments of the habit shirt.&nbsp;
By far the most remarkable varieties are observed in head
dresses, which frequently supply valuable indications as to the
date.&nbsp; On the cup presented by King John to the borough of
Lynn, and in the small figures upon Branch&rsquo;s monument, some
of the females wear a close-fitting cap like a child&rsquo;s
nightcap, and others a sort of hood with a long tail to it, which
is sometimes stiff and sometimes loose like drapery.&nbsp; The
wives of Walsoken and Branch (1349 and 1364) exhibit the wimple,
covering the throat, chin, and sides of the face, and the
couverchef (kerchief) thrown over the head and falling upon the
shoulders.&nbsp; The next important variety was the forked or
mitre head dress, which first came into fashion about 1438, and
held its ground for about twenty-six years, though there is one
specimen as late as 1492.&nbsp; This was followed by the
pedimental style of head dress, which began about 1415, and
continued till late into the following century.&nbsp; The
butterfly head dress, which was a cylindrical cap with a light
veil over it, stiffened and squared at the top, prevailed from
1466 to 1483.&nbsp; In 1538 we observe a graceful form of head
dress, like what is termed the Mary Queen of Scots&rsquo;
cap.&nbsp; The mantle, which was something like a cope, the
jaquette, which may be compared to the &ldquo;flanches of
heraldry,&rdquo; and excellent specimens of ancient embroidery,
may all be studied in the brass of Adam de Walsoken.&nbsp; About
the year 1460 we observe the aumoniere (like a reticule) hanging
from a lady&rsquo;s girdle, and also the rosary, terminating, not
with a cross, but with a tassel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page566"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 566</span>In
reference to the dresses of the male sex, the Rev. R. Hart gives
the following details as to municipal costumes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On the Lynn cup, already referred to, we
observe the jerkin, or short coat; also a sort of cape, or short
cloak; a larger cloak, and three or four sorts of head coverings,
viz., a low flat-topped cap; another something like a helmet; a
hat sloping upwards from the rim, and flat at the top; a hood
with a tail to it; and another exactly resembling what is now
termed a &lsquo;wide-awake.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the monuments of
Walsoken and Branch we notice the jerkin, the mantle, cloaks,
long and short, (in one instance festooned over the right
shoulder like the plaid of a Highlander,) and another long cloak,
curiously buttoned all down the front; also several kinds of
head-covering, some exactly similar to those which have been
recently described, others with a broad rim turned up, the top
being round-pointed or flat; and in one instance we observe a hat
and feather.&nbsp; In their monumental effigies the laity are
usually attired in a long gown, which has sometimes bag sleeves,
but resembles an albe in all other respects.&nbsp; It is usually
girdled with a leathern strap with a rosary of much larger beads
than we observe on female brasses, and without any decads.&nbsp;
Generally speaking, these rosaries have a tassel underneath, but
on the brass of Sir William Calthorp, 1495, a signet ring is
attached to the end of the rosary, while a beautiful shaped
aumoniere also hangs from the girdle.&nbsp; About the year 1532
we observe gowns with hanging sleeves, like those which are still
worn by masters of arts at our universities; and in other
instances, of about the same date, we observe a pudding sleeve
reaching a little below the elbow of the under dress.&nbsp; The
brass of Edmund Green, in Hunstanton church, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1490, is <a name="page567"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 567</span>chiefly remarkable from the
resemblance that his upper garment bears to a pelisse or furred
surtout.&nbsp; The short cloak&mdash;trunk hose (something like
the &lsquo;nickerbockers&rsquo; of our own time), and also the
ruff, are observable upon Norfolk brasses between 1610 and
1630.&nbsp; During the first half of the fifteenth century, we
observe a frightfully ugly mode of shaving of the hair all round,
to some height above the ears.&nbsp; It looks like a skull cap,
and is an exact inversion of the tonsure.&nbsp; Burgesses of Lynn
appear to have worn, in the fourteenth century, long gowns, the
lower part of which is open in the front about as high as the
knees, and with wide sleeves reaching to the elbow.&nbsp; There
is a richly bordered and hooded cape over the upper part of this
gown.&nbsp; It is not unlike an amess.&nbsp; Aldermen of Norwich
wore a mantle open at the right shoulder, falling straight
behind, but gathered into a slope at front, so as to cover a
great part of the left arm, while the other was exposed.&nbsp; It
had a standing collar, and there were buttons upon the right
shoulder.&nbsp; A Judge of the Common Pleas, in 1507, wore his
hair long and flowing, and was habited in a long wide-sleeved
gown, open in the front; apparently it was lined, caped, and
bordered with fur, and there is a purse hanging from the
girdle.&nbsp; On his feet he wore clogs of a very remarkable
form.&nbsp; A Judge of the King&rsquo;s Bench, in 1545, wore a
wide-sleeved long gown, a mantle open at the right shoulder, as
in the municipal examples, his head being covered with a coif or
closely-fitting skull-cap.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the earlier years of the reign of Elizabeth, the Flemings,
who fled from the persecutions of the Duke of Alva, settled at
Norwich to the number of 4000, and much increased the prosperity
of the city by <a name="page568"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
568</span>introducing the manufacture of bombazines, which were
long in great demand all over the country.&nbsp; Black bombazines
were universally worn by ladies when in mourning, up to a recent
period.&nbsp; These bombazines were mixed fabrics of silk and
worsted, and were dyed in all colours.&nbsp; They did not wear so
long as the more modern paramattas.</p>
<p>Elizabeth gave every encouragement to manufactures; and when
more Flemings sought refuge in England, the city of Norwich
gained an accession of knowledge in the art of weaving with a
warp of silk or linen, and a weft of worsted, as well as in
dyeing and other processes.&nbsp; And now the articles
manufactured began to be classed as &ldquo;bays, arras, says,
tapestries, mockadoes, stamens, russels, lace, fringes, camlets,
perpetuanas, caffas and kerseys.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing contributed
more to advance the prosperity of the city than the arrival of
the industrious Dutch people, who brought with them arts before
unknown in this land.</p>
<p>For centuries the action of government in reference to trade
was simply in the way of protection, creating monopolies under
charters, and sometimes for subsidies.&nbsp; This was especially
the case in Norwich, which was made one of the royal cities of
England, and had a market every day in the week, as well as
annual marts for all sorts of merchandise.&nbsp; The
manufacturers first sought and obtained protection for their
trade under charters.&nbsp; Hence arose a system which answered
very well in the infancy of society, but which became obsolete in
the course of national development, and the extension of
commerce.</p>
<p><a name="page569"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 569</span>Under
the miserable rule of Charles I., the persecuting Laud succeeded
in driving back the industrious Dutch weavers to Holland, and
causing others to emigrate to America in order that they might
enjoy religious liberty.&nbsp; Thus the best workers were driven
out of England, and a stimulus was given to the Dutch worsted
manufacture.&nbsp; The Commonwealth government restored
prosperity to trade, and established a corporation of fifty-four
persons in Norwich for the regulation of trade, which then
flourished exceedingly.</p>
<p>In the reign of Charles II., we find that
&ldquo;Weavers&rsquo; Hall&rdquo; is mentioned; and though the
king taxed the manufacturers, the Norwich workers flourished: for
Sir John Child, in 1681, declared that, &ldquo;Such a trade there
is, and hath been, for the woollen manufactures, as England never
knew in any age.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon afterwards, Louis XIV. revoked
the Edict of Nantes, and tens of thousands of French Protestant
weavers took refuge in England, giving birth to the silk
manufactures of Spitalfields, and stimulating the trade of
Norwich.&nbsp; These refugees introduced the manufacture of
crapes, which soon came into very general use for mourning.</p>
<h4><i>The Eighteenth Century</i>.</h4>
<p>Most of the manufacturers of this century were very
intelligent men, who had gone through the whole routine of their
trade, and could do the work in every process with their own
hands.&nbsp; The worsted goods manufactured at this time were
calimancoes, <a name="page570"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
570</span>plain, flowered, and brocaded; camlets and camletees;
satins and satinettes; brocaded satins, rosetts, brilliants,
batavias, Mecklenburghs, hairbines, damasks, duroys, poplins,
prunells, bombazines, serges, florentines, brilliantines,
grandines, cameltines, tabourtines, blondines, callimandres, and
other fabrics, all in brilliant colours.&nbsp; The greatest
demand for these goods was from 1743 to 1763, a period of twenty
years.</p>
<p>In or about 1776 Joseph and John Banfather made a few camlets,
which were woven grey, and after that, dyed of various colours,
for a captain of an East India vessel, who took them out at his
own risk.&nbsp; About 1782, broad bombazines were introduced by
Ives, Son, and Baseley.&nbsp; About 1783, Irish poplins or
lustres were made by that firm.&nbsp; About 1785, spotted
camletees were introduced by William Martin.&nbsp; About 1788,
single warp callimancoes were made and continued for six
years.</p>
<p>Mr. James assures us that Norwich attained its highest
prosperity during the middle of the eighteenth century, so great
was the energy and fertility of resource displayed by its
merchants.&nbsp; The worsted dyers of the city were pre-eminent
for skill, and their profits were great.&nbsp; The city merchants
sent travellers throughout Europe, and their pattern books were
shown in every principal town as far as Moscow.&nbsp; Norwich
goods were introduced into France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, and
Poland, and there was also a large trade with Russia.&nbsp; The
great fairs of Frankfort, Leipsic, and of Salerno, were thronged
with purchasers of Norwich fabrics.&nbsp; An <i>English
Gazetter</i> <a name="page571"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
571</span>published before 1726, contains an article on Norwich,
in which the writer says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The worsted manufacture, for which this
city has long been famous, and in which even children earn their
bread, was first brought over by the Flemings in the reign of
Edward III., and afterwards very much improved by the Dutch who
fled from the Duke of Alva&rsquo;s persecution, and being settled
here by queen Elizabeth, taught the inhabitants to make says,
baize, serges, shalloons, &amp;c., in which they carry on a vast
trade both at home and abroad, and weave camblets, druggets,
crapes, and other stuffs, of which it is said this city vends to
the value of &pound;200,000 a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weavers here employ spinsters all the country
round, and also use many thousand packs of yarn spun in other
counties, even as far as Yorkshire and Westmoreland.&nbsp; By a
late calculation from the number of looms at work in this city
only, it appeared that there were no less than one hundred and
twenty thousand people employed in these manufactures of wool,
silk, &amp;c., in and about the town, <i>including those employed
in spinning the yarn</i>, used for such goods as are made in the
city.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer of course means to include all the females who spun
the yarns in Yorkshire and Westmoreland, as well as in Norfolk
and Norwich.&nbsp; Even then, 120,000 people is an incredible
number, for he states the value of all the goods sold to be only
&pound;200,000 yearly, so that the people would not earn &pound;2
each per annum.</p>
<p>So flourishing was the woollen trade in this city during the
second half of the eighteenth century, that on February 2nd,
1759, the wool-combers testified <a name="page572"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 572</span>their joy by exhibiting the pageant
of bishop Blaise, who lived under Dioclesian, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 282, and was a great patron of
woollen manufactures.&nbsp; This prosperity was interrupted by a
war; but on March 24th, 1783, the citizens were again entertained
by the wool-combers&rsquo; jubilee, on the return of peace, which
had a beneficial effect on trade.&nbsp; The most prosperous
period appears to have been from 1750 to 1780.</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur Young, in 1771, published his &ldquo;Tour of
England&rdquo; in the form of Letters, some of which relate to
the eastern counties, and Letter XII. to Norwich.&nbsp; It
contains a curious statement, derived from some manufacturers,
respecting their trade.&nbsp; At that time, the population of the
city was about 40,000, mostly employed in manufactures, and the
merchants were rich and numerous.&nbsp; Mr. Arthur Young
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The staple manufactures are crapes and
camlets, besides which they make in great abundance damasks,
satins, alopeens, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; They work up the
Leicestershire and Lincolnshire wool chiefly, which is brought
here for combing and spinning, whilst the Norfolk wool goes to
Yorkshire for carding and cloths.&nbsp; And what is a remarkable
circumstance, not discovered many years, is, that the Norfolk
sheep yield a wool about their necks equal to the best from
Spain; and is in price to the rest as twenty to seven.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Arthur Young further states that men, women, and boys
earned about five shillings per week, but that they could earn
more if industrious, so that wages were not higher a century ago
than at present.&nbsp; In reference to the exportation of goods,
he observes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page573"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
573</span>&ldquo;They now do not send anything to North America,
but much to the West Indies.&nbsp; Their foreign export is to
Rotterdam, Ostend, Middleburgh, all Flanders, Leghorn, Trieste,
Naples, Genoa, Cadiz, Lisbon, Barcelona, Hamburgh, all the Baltic
except Sweden, and the East Indies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general amount of Norwich manufactures may be
calculated thus&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>A regular export to Rotterdam, by shipping every six
weeks, of goods to the amount of yearly</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">&pound;480,000</p>

<tr>
<td><p>Twenty-six tons of goods sent by broad-wheeled waggons

</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">&pound;1,356,000</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Therefore the trade had increased in fifty years from
&pound;200,000, according to the &ldquo;English Gazetteer,&rdquo;
up to &pound;1,356,000!</p>
<p>Mr. Young further observes in reference to the estimates he
had given:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Upon a reconsideration of the table, it was
thought that the &pound;676,000 by waggons was rather too
high.&nbsp; Suppose, therefore, only 10,000 tons, it is then
&pound;520,000, and the total &pound;1,200,000!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another method taken to calculate the amount was by
adding up the total sum supposed to be returned annually by every
house in Norwich, and this method made it &pound;1,150,000.&nbsp;
This sum coming so near the other, is a strong confirmation of
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A third method taken was to calculate the number of <a
name="page574"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 574</span>looms (in
county and city); these were made 12,000; and it is a common idea
in Norwich to suppose such, with all its attendants, works
&pound;100 per annum.&nbsp; This also makes the total
&pound;1,200,000, which sum upon the whole appears to be very
near the real truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respecting the proportion between the original material
and the labour employed upon it, they have a sure and very easy
method of discovering it.&nbsp; The average value of a piece of
stuff is 5s.; so the material is a tenth of the total
manufacture.&nbsp; Deduct the &pound;120,000 from
&pound;1,200,000, leaves &pound;1,080,000 for labour, in which is
included the profit of the manufacturer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The material point remaining is to discover how many
people are employed to earn the public one million per annum, and
for this calculation I have one <i>datum</i> which is to the
purpose.&nbsp; They generally imagine in Norwich that one loom
employs six persons on the whole; and as the number is 12,000 (in
city and county), there are consequently 72,000 people employed
in the manufacture.&nbsp; And this is a fresh confirmation of the
preceding accounts; for I was in general told that more hands
worked out of Norwich, for many miles around, than in it; and
&pound;1,200,000 divided by 72,000, gives &pound;16 each for the
earnings of every person.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, Mr. Young confesses, appears to be a large sum for men,
women, and boys to earn.&nbsp; The population of Norwich being
then under 40,000, the number of looms at the time Mr. A. Young
wrote could not be 12,000, nor the persons employed 72,000 in the
city and county.&nbsp; Six persons to a loom never were required
at one time.&nbsp; The proportion was more likely only half, or
three persons to a loom.&nbsp; Consequently, the number employed
would be only 36,000 <a name="page575"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 575</span>in both city and county.&nbsp;
Divide &pound;1,200,000 by 36,000, and it gives &pound;33 for
each adult yearly, including the profits of the
manufacturer.&nbsp; Deduct &pound;200,000 for their profits, and
it leaves &pound;1,000,000 for labour; divide that by 36,000
persons, and it leaves only &pound;28 each, yearly, which is
nearer the mark.</p>
<p>Mr. R. Beatniffe, a bookseller in Norwich, copied the
statement of Mr. A. Young, and published it in his &ldquo;Tour of
Norfolk.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said some gentlemen of intelligence had
doubted it, as well they might, but he believed it was
true.&nbsp; However, in his last edition of the
&ldquo;Tour,&rdquo; published in 1807, he gave a very different
account.&nbsp; He said that the merchant was shut out of the home
market by fashion and out of the foreign market by war, so that
the annual value of the goods was estimated at &pound;800,000,
and the cost of labour at &pound;685,000, leaving only
&pound;115,000 for the raw material</p>
<p>Messrs. John Scott and Sons, were manufacturers of woollen and
worsted goods, in St. Saviour&rsquo;s, from 1766 to 1800, and
produced great quantities of taborets, floretts, clouded camlets,
for Italy; perukeens, self-coloured camlets, for Germany; and
other sorts for Spain.&nbsp; Some of these camlets were eighteen
inches wide, and the pieces twenty-seven or thirty yards in
length; some super camlets were twenty-four inches wide, and
thirty yards in length, according to the pattern books yet in
existence.&nbsp; These camlets were charged from 50s. to 100s.
per piece, or an average of 80s., as we have seen in old ledgers
of the firm, still preserved and in the possession of a
manufacturer.</p>
<p><a name="page576"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
576</span>Originally, all the yarns used in Norwich were spun by
hand in Norfolk and Suffolk, thus employing a large number of
women, young and old.&nbsp; About 1720, almost the whole female
population of Norfolk and Suffolk was fully employed at the
spinning wheel, and this branch of industry continued till the
end of the century, and though 50,000 tons of wool were produced,
it was found necessary to draw supplies from other
districts.&nbsp; Before the end of the eighteenth century, mills
were at work spinning yarns, and in 1812, yarns from the mills in
Lancashire were brought here and spun in bombazines, which were
dyed in various colours.</p>
<p>The establishment of mills in Yorkshire, where coal,
provisions, and labour were cheaper than in Norfolk, gave a heavy
blow to the trade of the city, which would have been more
severely felt, but for the fluctuations of fashion having created
a great demand for bombazines, for which Norwich was
famous.&nbsp; The Yorkshire workmen and the substitution of
machinery for female hands, reduced the manufacture of the old
kinds of goods to a low point, and the trade was chiefly
maintained by the orders of the East India Company for large
quantities of camlets for the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Messrs. Willett and Nephew have old pattern books full of
specimens of shawl borders of very elegant designs; in fashion at
the beginning of this century.&nbsp; These patterns are an
imitation of genuine Indian designs, the pine-apple being
prominent; but great improvements in the designs were made by
different <a name="page577"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
577</span>manufacturers.&nbsp; Norwich shawls had formerly a high
reputation, and were in great demand in London and all large
towns; but ultimately French shawls were preferred, owing to the
superiority of the designs.</p>
<p>At two general meetings of the manufacturers, held at the
Guildhall on December 14th and 21st, 1790, the prices for weaving
were fixed and printed in a list, comprising serges, prunelles,
satins, satinettes, camlets, camletines, florentines,
brilliantines, grenadines, blondines, tabourtines, callandres,
&amp;c.&nbsp; At a general meeting of the manufacturers, held on
June 13th, 1793, at the Guildhall, it was resolved unanimously
that they would supply the journeyman weavers they employed with
havels and slaies, free of charge, and without deduction from the
prices established in the table of rates fixed in the year
1790.&nbsp; The list continued in force for some time, even into
the next century.&nbsp; The camlets made, excepting those for
China, were thirty yards in length, and about twenty-eight inches
wide, with warp and wift dyed in the hank.&nbsp; Millions of
pieces of camlets were made for exportation, in which nearly all
the manufacturers were engaged.&nbsp; The orders of the East
India Company amounted to a very large sum yearly.&nbsp;
Operatives earned 40s. for each piece of camlet for the East
India Company, or about &pound;1000 weekly on that single
article.&nbsp; Those were the palmy days for the weavers; days
that will never more return.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the century, the prosperity of Norwich
really declined.&nbsp; The towns of the West Riding of Yorkshire,
as already stated, became her <a name="page578"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 578</span>successful rivals in worsted
fabrics.&nbsp; The increase of cottons and their general wear in
England left Norwich dependent on the foreign trade, which was
partly ruined by the American war, and entirely so by the war
after the first French Revolution, which spread desolation over
all Europe.</p>
<h4><i>The Nineteenth Century</i>.</h4>
<p>At the commencement of the present century, bombazines,
camlets, and mixed fabrics were the chief manufactures of
Norwich.&nbsp; Soon afterwards crapes were produced in large
quantities.&nbsp; Paramattas were next introduced, and in the
course of time superseded bombazines for mourning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Poplins&rdquo; then came into fashion, and the manufacture
has so much improved that the demand for this kind of goods has
increased every year.&nbsp; Poplins were followed by a long
succession of mixed fabrics, bar&egrave;ges, balzarines, gauzes,
mousseline de laines, cotton de laines, llamas, thibets,
merinoes, lunettas, organdies, stuffs, cloths, velvets, lustres,
silks, satins, &amp;c.&nbsp; The manufacture of shawls was also
carried on extensively, and for a long time Norwich shawls, for
excellence of fabric and elegance of design, were not surpassed
by any made in England.&nbsp; A great trade was done in shawls in
Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, and other large towns.&nbsp; The
trade, however, gradually declined when French shawls came into
fashion.&nbsp; French goods of other kinds also grew in favour,
and affected the city trade in many textile fabrics.</p>
<p><a name="page579"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 579</span>In
1829, on December 29th, a meeting of weavers was held on
Mousehold Heath to adopt means for keeping up the rate of
payment, the operatives asserting their right to combine to
increase wages, as well as their employers to combine to reduce
them.&nbsp; The weavers were not paid by time, but at a certain
rate for piece-work of different kinds.&nbsp; The rate was
according to a certain printed scale, to which the operatives
wished to adhere, while it sometimes occurred that the
manufacturers desired to alter it.</p>
<p>During the early part of the present century Messrs. Ives and
Robberds, of St. Saviour&rsquo;s, carried on a large trade in
worsted goods, chiefly for exportation to India and China, and to
different parts of Europe.&nbsp; The goods made were all stout
worsted fabrics, plain, checked, striped, or figured, in vivid
colours.&nbsp; They were camlets, camletees, satins, satinettes,
ladines, tabaretts, calimancoes, swan skins, broad bays, red
kerseys, diamantines, spotted tobines, batavias, hairbines, toys,
Rochdale bays, checked paolis, lustrins, dentellos, damasks,
dorsettines, poplins, serges, mazarines, and grenadines.&nbsp;
The same firm received large orders from the East India Company
for camlets, in pieces 55 yards in length, 30 inches in width,
and weighing 20 lbs. each.&nbsp; Orders were executed by various
houses as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>He also continued to make camlets for wholesale merchants in
London till 1848, when he failed in consequence of losses, but
afterwards joined a partner in Halifax, and continued to produce
large quantities of camlets; but Norwich lost all the trade.</p>
<p>Besides the camlets supplied to the East India Company, goods
of the same kind were made for private orders by all the
manufacturers.&nbsp; During the years 1830, 1831, and 1832,
according to ledgers yet remaining, one firm made about 7,000
pieces for private orders, and from 1833 to 1837 inclusive,
nearly 9,000 pieces.&nbsp; In 1833 and 1834, mohair camlets were
made by the same house to the extent of 6,000 pieces, being
22,000 pieces in four years.&nbsp; Supposing a dozen other houses
to have produced a like quantity, the total <a
name="page581"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 581</span>would have
been 66,000 pieces yearly.&nbsp; Messrs. Booth and Theobald, in
Muspole Street, were large manufacturers of worsted goods, and at
one time employed about 1,000 hands, men, women, and children, in
the production of worsted goods, including camlets, for the East
India Company.&nbsp; Mr. John Francis, of St. George&rsquo;s,
also made a variety of worsted goods and other fabrics, employing
a large number of hands at one time.&nbsp; Messrs. Worth and
Carter, in St. George&rsquo;s Middle Street, and Joseph Oxley and
Sons, in St. Augustine&rsquo;s, produced large quantities of
broad bombazines, which were gradually superseded by paramattas,
to which the ladies gave the preference.&nbsp; Both fabrics were
made of worsted and silk; the only difference was that they were
differently dressed, the paramattas being dressed flat by hot
pressing, which gave a greater flexibility to the cloth.&nbsp;
Messrs. Wright and Son, formerly on Elm Hill, at one time
employed about 1500 hand-loom weavers in the manufacture of plain
and fancy fabrics, mostly mixed.</p>
<p>Messrs. Grout and Co. began the manufacture of crapes in a
small way in Patteson&rsquo;s Yard, in Magdalen Street.&nbsp;
John Grout was then the principal partner, but after the mills
were built in Lower Westwick Street, having realized a fortune,
he retired from business.&nbsp; George Grout also retired before
1840.&nbsp; Messrs. Martin and Company became the proprietors of
the mills, and after Mr. Martin died, the firm comprised Messrs.
Brown, Robison, and Hall, who now carry on a large trade in
crapes, areophanes, and gauzes.&nbsp; The machinery in use is of
the most improved construction; <a name="page582"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 582</span>and in these very extensive works
may be seen most of the processes connected with the manufacture
of silk goods.&nbsp; The silk is imported chiefly from China and
some from India, but a portion is also obtained from Italy.&nbsp;
The demand for crapes used in mourning has, however, a good deal
diminished.</p>
<p>The Albion Mills, in King Street, were erected in 1836 and
1837, for the spinning of worsted yarns, in consequence of the
great demand in Norwich and the difficulty found by manufacturers
in obtaining the yarns which they required for their trade.&nbsp;
Mr. George Jay, owner of the mills, erected new machinery.&nbsp;
And after the trade in worsted yarns declined, he imported mohair
from Asia Minor, and commenced the spinning of mohair
yarns.&nbsp; He continued this business for some years, while
mohair goods were in demand.&nbsp; He added a new wing to the
factory and put in another steam engine, both the engines being
of seventy-horse power.</p>
<p>During the present century, large Mills have been built in
this city for the spinning of silk, woollen, and mohair yarns,
and also for weaving those yarns into all kinds of fabrics.&nbsp;
In the year 1833, a company was organised for those
manufactures.&nbsp; A large capital of &pound;40,000 was raised,
and ultimately two factories were built, one in St.
Edmund&rsquo;s and one in St. James&rsquo;.&nbsp; The former
became a factory for spinning yarns, and the latter for weaving
goods.&nbsp; In St. James&rsquo; factory two coupled engines of
100-horse power were put up to drive the machinery.&nbsp; There
the city manufacturers hired the large rooms and power, and put
in the machinery, for the production of fabrics.</p>
<p><a name="page583"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 583</span>The
site of the factory comprises 1a. 2r. 18p., with a frontage of
460 feet to the river.&nbsp; Above the basement are six long
floors.&nbsp; There have been sixty-five frames in the mills for
spinning yarns, and 500 looms for weaving fabrics; but the number
of looms has been reduced to 300, and they are not always at
work.&nbsp; After the erection of the mills, weaving sheds were
built adjoining.&nbsp; The floors are now occupied as
follows;&mdash;No. 1. Messrs. Skelton and Co; No. 2. Messrs.
Towler, Rowling, and Allen, who also hire two of the weaving
sheds; No. 3. Messrs. Willett, Nephew, and Co.; No. 4. Messrs.
Skelton and Co.: Nos. 5 and 6. Mr. Park, for spinning woollen
yarns.&nbsp; Women and girls are chiefly employed in this
factory.&nbsp; About 1000 have been at work at a time, when trade
has been good; but of late, not half the number have been
engaged.&nbsp; The average earnings have been about 7s.
weekly.</p>
<p>In 1838, trade was in a very dull declining state, and some
differences arose between masters and men, in consequence of a
proposed reduction in the rate of payment.&nbsp; This was
resisted by the men, who appealed to Colonel Harvey to mediate
between them, which he consented to do.&nbsp; A meeting was held,
and the delegates who had been sent on the part of the weavers to
the north to inquire into the state of the camlet trade, reported
that they had seen no camlets at all to compare with those in
Norwich.&nbsp; The north had, however, got the trade.&nbsp; The
question remained unsettled; but on August 27th, that year,
several camlet weavers applied to the magistrates for protection
from <a name="page584"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 584</span>the
violence of those on strike.&nbsp; Mr. Robberds was willing to
give out work, but would not do so unless his men were
protected.&nbsp; The application was granted, and a strong body
of police was sent to the premises of Mr. Robberds, where the
weavers received their work, and they were protected in conveying
it to their homes.&nbsp; On the Tuesday following, the house of a
man named Wells was broken open and his work cut out of the
loom.&nbsp; The city was much disturbed by these differences,
which ultimately produced great injury to its trade.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Mitchell&rsquo;s report in 1839, there were
in the city and its vicinity 5,075 looms, of which 1,021 were
unemployed; and of the 4,054 looms then at work, there were 3,398
in the houses of the weavers, and 650 in shops and
factories.&nbsp; Indeed, by far the greater part of the looms
belonged to families having only one or two.&nbsp; The operatives
at these looms comprised 2,211 men, and 1,648 women, with 195
children.&nbsp; In that year two silk mills employed 731 hands;
three worsted mills, 385 hands; two woollen mills, 39 hands; and
one cotton mill, 39 hands, making eight mills, employing 1,285
persons.</p>
<p>An abstract of a census of the Norwich weavers, furnished by a
report of the commissioners on handloom weavers, published in
1840, will best show the nature and the relative amount of the
fabrics then made by hand.&nbsp; Bombazines employed 1,205
workers, of whom 803 were men; challis, Yorkshire stuffs,
fringes, &amp;c., 1,247, of whom 510 were men; gauzes, 500,
chiefly women; princettas, 242, nearly all men; <a
name="page585"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 585</span>silk
shawls, 166, of whom 74 were men; bandana, 158, of whom 86 were
men; silk, 38, including 16 men; jacquard, 30; worsted shawls,
26; woollen and couch lace, 22 each; camletees, 20; horsehair
cloth, 17; lustres, 3; sacking, 45.&nbsp; Total of weavers 4,054,
including 2,211 men, 1,648 women, 108 boys, 77 girls, and 10
apprentices.&nbsp; Their gross wages, when fully employed, have
ranged from 8s. to 25s. weekly; those engaged on fillovers,
challis, and fine bombazines, earning from 15s. to 25s. weekly;
but deducting &ldquo;play time&rdquo; and expenses, the net wages
did not amount to 8s. weekly.&nbsp; Mr. Mitchell reported that
the industry and morals of the operatives had suffered much from
party spirit, riots, and strikes.&nbsp; Of late years the workers
at their looms have been very industrious and quiet, while they
have endured great privations.&nbsp; Since 1840 a large number of
the operatives have gone into the boot and shoe trade, which
offered better prospect of at least a decent livelihood.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Present State of the Trade</span>.</h4>
<p>Most of the old worsted fabrics formerly made in such large
quantities have become obsolete, and lighter mixed fabrics are
now produced in great variety, in silk, wool, mohair or cotton,
or composed of three or four kinds of yarns.&nbsp; The goods are
known under the names of cloths, kerseys, linseys, winseys,
coburgs, crapes, gauzes, nets, paramattas, camlets, bareges,
balzarines, grenadines, challis, llamas, poplins, poplinettes,
tamataves, optimes, crinolines, cloakings, and <a
name="page586"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 586</span>shawls in
great variety.&nbsp; Wool, mohair, and cotton yarns are chiefly
used in most of the fabrics, except crapes and gauzes.&nbsp; The
larger proportion of the woollen yarns are made here from English
wool.&nbsp; Poplins are made of silk and worsted; poplinettes, of
silk and cotton; bareges, of silk and worsted; tamataves, of
worsted and cotton; grenadines, of twisted worsted and silk;
coburgs, of cotton and worsted; paramattas and bombazines, of
worsted and silk; llamas, of an inferior kind of wool with cotton
warp; thibet cloths, of worsted warp and weft; winseys and
linseys, of worsted with cotton warp; balzarines, with cotton
warps and worsted shoot; malabars, of cotton warp and woollen
shoot, thirty-two inches wide.&nbsp; All the fabrics, however,
may be included under the three classes of tammies, tamataves,
and nets.&nbsp; The tammies are woven fabrics, in which the warp
and the weft simply cross, but in the nets there is a twist in
the warp.&nbsp; The tamataves are partly the tammy woven and
partly the net.&nbsp; In former times the trade was comparatively
steady, because plain fabrics in single colours were more in
demand than any other; but of late years, this branch of business
has been very fluctuating, owing to the changes of fashion and
the desire for novelty, both in the fabric and in the pattern of
every article.&nbsp; New patterns are now, therefore, constantly
being produced.&nbsp; All preparations and processes are only for
the coming season, and it is found necessary to alter the
pattern, the colouring, the finishing, and even the names of the
goods, to suit the markets.</p>
<p><a name="page587"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 587</span>Mr.
G. Jay is the largest manufacturer of mohair yarns in this city;
and in the years 1867 and 1868 he could not execute all the
orders he received.&nbsp; This arose from the great care bestowed
on the preparation of the material at the Albion Mills, in King
Street, and from the softness of the water which imparts a
glossy, silky appearance to the yarns.&nbsp; Mohair fabrics came
suddenly into use, and for some years prior to 1860, elegant
tissues were produced here.&nbsp; These, however, soon went out
of fashion.&nbsp; All the yarns spun here are now sent to France
and Germany, where they are woven, with silk, into velvets, and
then imported into this country.&nbsp; The velvet jackets which
are now in fashion have caused a great demand for these yarns,
and sixty-five frames at the Albion Mills are constantly at
work.&nbsp; We are only surprised that the yarns are not used in
the city in the manufacture of velvets, large quantities of which
are imported every year.</p>
<p>Norwich was the first place in all England where the
manufacture of fillover shawls was carried on to any great
extent.&nbsp; For a long time the weaving of these shawls was a
tedious, slow process.&nbsp; A great improvement in the mode of
weaving was, however, discovered by a straw-hat maker of Lyons,
named Jacquard, in the year 1802, by which means the drawboys
were entirely dispensed with and the tackle simplified.&nbsp; The
new invention was received as a boon in England, and at length
was introduced into this city, where it has been applied to the
production of splendid fillover shawls, by Clabburn, Sons, and
Crisp.&nbsp; <a name="page588"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
588</span>We regret, however, that these elegant articles of
ladies attire have recently gone almost entirely out of
fashion.</p>
<p>The Late Mr. T. O. Springfield carried on the wholesale silk
business to a very large extent, having almost a monopoly of the
market, and he supplied with dressed silk almost all the
manufacturers in this city.&nbsp; This silk was very largely used
by Grout and Co., in the manufacture of crape, gauzes,
aerophanes, &amp;c., and by others in the working up of mixed
fabrics, especially bareges, grenadines, and various light
tissues.&nbsp; The same wholesale business is now continued by
Mr. O. Springfield, in Norwich and London.&nbsp; It is estimated
that the annual value of dressed silk used in this city is over
&pound;100,000.</p>
<p>Messrs. Middleton, Answorth, and Co., have a large factory in
Calvert Street, another in Bradford, and a wholesale warehouse in
London.&nbsp; They formerly made all kinds of mixed fabrics in
this city, and now they produce large quantities of paramattas,
grenadines, opera cloakings, and fancy cloakings, hair cloth for
crinolines, and curled hair for stuffing sofas.&nbsp; Crinolines
have been made in great quantities by this firm, the warp being
cotton and the weft horsehair.&nbsp; The demand for them has,
however, somewhat abated.&nbsp; This firm has largely increased
their trade in hair-cloth, which is used for general stiffening
purposes.&nbsp; In the southern states of America, the gentlemen
wear large trousers, which require to be expanded like
ladies&rsquo; dresses; and, therefore, the larger portion of
these goods are sent to the southern states of <a
name="page589"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
589</span>America.&nbsp; The same firm has also introduced
haircloth in many patterns and colours for covering furniture, in
sofas, chairs, &amp;c.&nbsp; There is an enormous importation of
horse-hair into England from Russia, and from the continent of
South America, where horses run wild in the great plains called
&ldquo;Pampas.&rdquo;&nbsp; The horses are caught and divested of
their tails, which are brought into this country in a very rough
state; the hair is dressed and woven into a variety of fabrics
which are in great demand.&nbsp; The trade in horse-hair cloth is
almost a new trade in the city and might be greatly
extended.&nbsp; Some fabrics are made all horse-hair, and some
mixed with spun silk, in stripes, and colours, and very pleasing
patterns.</p>
<p>Mr. J. Burrell has built a small mill near the Dereham Road,
where he carries on the manufacture of horse-hair cloth by means
of peculiar looms and machinery.&nbsp; He imports horse hair, and
prepares it for stuffing seats of chairs, sofas, &amp;c.&nbsp; He
also weaves horse hair into cloth for various purposes.&nbsp; Mr.
Gunton also carries on the same kind of manufacture in St.
Miles&rsquo;; but the trade is yet on a small scale in this
city.</p>
<p>Messrs. Clabburn, Sons, and Crisp, in Pitt Street, manufacture
shawls in every variety, and also paramattas, bareges, tamataves,
balzarines, poplins, fancy robes, ophines, grenadines, and mixed
fabrics generally.&nbsp; The fillover long shawls produced by
this firm, on a Jacquard loom, gained the gold medal at the first
Paris Exhibition, and also at the London Exhibition in
1862.&nbsp; No description could convey an adequate <a
name="page590"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 590</span>idea of
these splendid fillover shawls, which are made by a patented
process, so as to display a self colour and a perfect design on
each side.&nbsp; They were on view at the Paris Exhibition, in
1867, but not for a prize, Mr. W. Clabburn being selected as one
of the judges, so that his firm could not compete.</p>
<p>Messrs. Willett and Nephew, of Pottergate Street, are
manufacturers on a large scale.&nbsp; The factory itself is not
very extensive, for most of the weavers work for the firm at
their own houses; and there, in humble dwellings, produce the
beautiful fancy fabrics, which are destined to adorn the
daintiest ladies in the land.&nbsp; The extent of the operations
of this firm enables them to introduce a great variety of
novelties in every season, and thus to compete successfully with
the manufacturers of France.&nbsp; They were the first to
introduce the manufacture of paramattas, which superseded the
bombazines, at one time in such great demand.&nbsp; They produce
superior poplins, (plain, figured, and watered) bareges,
balzarines, tamataves, coburgs, camlets, challis, crinoline,
cr&ecirc;pe de Lyons, grenadines, shawls, scarfs, robes, and also
a great variety of plain fabrics.&nbsp; They exhibited a large
assortment of goods at the London Exhibition of 1851, and
received a certificate of &ldquo;honourable mention&rdquo; for
their paramattas, being the only award made for that
article.&nbsp; Messrs. Willett and Co. also received a silver
medal at the last Exhibition in Paris.&nbsp; In 1867, the same
firm supplied some rich poplins, which were selected for the
queen and royal family, from the stock of Mr. Caley, in London
Street.&nbsp; Mr. Caley has always <a name="page591"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 591</span>on hand a large stock of Norwich
goods, including shawls and fancy fabrics of the newest
designs.&nbsp; Visitors to Norwich should not fail to call at his
establishment, if they wish to carry away any idea of the
productions of the old city.</p>
<p>Messrs. C. and F. Bolingbroke and Jones, manufacturers of all
kinds of textile fabrics, carry on a large business in a building
which was formerly the city residence of the priors of
Ixworth.&nbsp; On an old door, which formerly opened into the
prior&rsquo;s hall, is the following inscription in black letter
on the transoms which divide the panels:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Maria plena, mater mic<br />
Remembyr Wylly&aacute; Lowth, Prior 18.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>William Louth was the 18th Prior of Walsingham, from 1505 to
1515.&nbsp; This door has been noticed by Blomefield and others,
but not correctly; Mr. H. Harrod gave an engraving with
description in his &ldquo;Gleanings Among the Castles and
Convents of Norfolk,&rdquo; (1857).&nbsp; John Aldrich, a grocer,
resided here prior to 1549.&nbsp; He was elected an alderman in
1544, sheriff in 1551, mayor in 1558 and 1570, and member of
parliament for Norwich in 1555, 1558, and 1572.&nbsp; He was
buried inside of St. Clement&rsquo;s church, on the north side of
the chancel, June 12th, 1582.&nbsp; His wife, Elizabeth Aldrich,
was buried there April 3rd, 1587.&nbsp; Messrs. C. and F.
Bolingbroke and Jones have almost rebuilt the house.&nbsp; They
produce large quantities of textile fabrics, including poplins
(plain, figured, and watered) paramattas, bareges, winseys,
linseys, grenadines, <a name="page592"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 592</span>and a variety of fancy goods for
dresses, which are in great demand.&nbsp; At the first Great
Exhibition of 1851 a medal was awarded to this firm for poplins,
and at the Great Exhibition of 1862 for poplins and
poplinettes.&nbsp; In addition to the old extensive premises, the
firm, some time since, purchased the steam-power mills in Calvert
Street, and they also occupy a steam-power shed at St.
James&rsquo; factory.</p>
<p>Messrs. Towler, Rowling, and Allen, of Elm Hill, occupy large
rooms in the new buildings adjoining St. James&rsquo; factory,
where they produce large quantities of plain and fancy goods,
which have been in great demand.&nbsp; They make also large
quantities of plain fabrics, for wholesale houses only.&nbsp; At
the London Exhibition of 1862, honourable mention was made of the
shawls of this firm.</p>
<p>Mr. J. L Barber has a large establishment in St.
Martin&rsquo;s Lane, where he carries on business, making reels
and winding cotton on them.&nbsp; He supplies great quantities of
cotton-thread to wholesale and retail houses.</p>
<p>Messrs. Sultzer and Co. carry on the manufacture of crapes to
a considerable extent in premises built for the purpose in St.
Augustine&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Messrs. F. Hindes and Sons, who have a warehouse in Botolph
Street, manufacture paramattas, bareges, tamataves, grenadines,
poplins, shawls, and cloakings.&nbsp; They hire a floor also in
the steam-power factory.</p>
<p>Messrs. French and Co. formed a Limited Liability Company, and
built a new factory in the Mill Yard Lane, where they manufacture
crapes, which are in great demand.</p>
<p><a name="page593"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
593</span>Messrs. Grout and Co., manufacturers of gauzes, crapes,
aerophanes, &amp;c., in addition to their mills in Norwich, have
other mills at Yarmouth and Ditchingham, and at Ponder&rsquo;s
End near London.&nbsp; Theirs is, in fact, the greatest concern
in the world in the production of crapes and other silk
goods.&nbsp; In their several mills they employ about 2000
hands.</p>
<p>Mr. George Allen erected a large factory in 1857 in St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Back Street, for the manufacture of elastic
cloths for table covers, gloves, shawls, and other clothing
purposes, and for the production also of silk and lisle
webs.&nbsp; The elastic cloths, which are made upon warp frames,
are considered to be a great improvement on &ldquo;Hooper&rsquo;s
Elastics,&rdquo; made in the west of England, and for wear they
are believed to be unsurpassed.&nbsp; The manufacture gives
employment to a considerable number of hands.</p>
<p>About 500 power looms are at work in the city, when trade is
good, weaving a great variety of mixed fabrics, and no doubt each
loom does double the work of the old hand-loom.&nbsp; Supposing
each loom to produce one piece of goods weekly, there would be
500 pieces weekly, or 26,000 pieces yearly.&nbsp; The prices vary
in value from &pound;1 to &pound;10 per piece, and may be
averaged at &pound;5, so that the annual value would be about
&pound;130,000.&nbsp; But at least 500 hand-looms are also at
work, and supposing that they produce half the quantity of goods,
the total annual value would be &pound;195,000, or in round
numbers &pound;200,000.&nbsp; We are sorry to state, however, as
already intimated, that the manufacture of textile fabrics in
Norwich has for some time past <a name="page594"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 594</span>been declining, and cannot compare
with former years.&nbsp; The depression has arisen from various
causes, among which may be mentioned war, which has deprived the
city of its best markets.&nbsp; The introduction of cotton and
silk goods too has nearly superseded the old stuff fabrics of the
city.&nbsp; Machinery in Norwich is also behind that in the
north.&nbsp; The wool grown in Norfolk and Suffolk has, moreover,
been sent to Yorkshire to be spun, and has been repurchased as
yarn for Norwich goods; and lastly, Norwich weavers have not the
energy of those in Bradford.&nbsp; Fashion also has been one of
the causes of the loss of trade, for the fashions are continually
changing, and Norwich firms have to compete with all England,
Scotland, and France; and it is not to be expected that a few
houses in this city will produce as many novelties as all the
rest of the world.&nbsp; A School of Art has been established,
but it has not yet produced many practical designers.</p>

595</span>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> given an account of the
textile manufactures in this city, we proceed to furnish some
particulars of the more important of other classes of business,
which go to make up the sum total of the trade and commerce of
the city.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Banking Business</span>.</h4>
<p>Banking, as now understood, was not carried on till the
eighteenth century.&nbsp; Before the American war of Independence
very few country banks were established.&nbsp; Norwich
manufactures were in their most prosperous state in the middle of
last century, and then it was that some banks were established in
this city.&nbsp; On January 31st, 1756, a bank was opened in the
Upper Market by Charles Weston, who carried on business till the
end of the century.&nbsp; In 1768, Mr. Thomas Allday&rsquo;s bank
was opened; afterwards Sir R. Kerrison and Son were proprietors,
and in 1808 the bank failed.&nbsp; The debts amounted to
&pound;460,000, and the dividends paid amounted to 16s. 4d. in
the pound.&nbsp; This was the <a name="page596"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 596</span>first bank failure in Norwich of any
importance, and it shook public confidence in banks.</p>
<p>Messrs. Gurney&rsquo;s bank was established in Norwich in 1775
as a bank of deposit and issue.&nbsp; This was at a period the
most flourishing in the commercial annals of Norwich.&nbsp; The
annual value of textile fabrics produced in the city was over a
million sterling, a trade which was of course a great source of
business to the bank.&nbsp; Henry Gurney, and his son Bartlett
Gurney, were the first proprietors.&nbsp; On the death of the
father, the son associated himself with his three brothers,
Richard, Joseph, and John Gurney; so the firm continued till the
deaths of the different parties.&nbsp; About 1825, Mr. H.
Birkbeck, of Lynn, and Mr. Simon Martin were taken in as
partners.&nbsp; The firm then comprised R. H. Gurney, J. J.
Gurney, D. Gurney, Simon Martin, and H. Birkbeck.&nbsp; After J.
J. Gurney and S. Martin died, the firm comprised D. Gurney, J. H.
Gurney, H. Birkbeck, F. H. Gurney, and C. H. Gurney; and W.
Birkbeck came in after the death of his father.&nbsp; The bank at
Norwich has in its connection branches at North Walsham, Aylsham,
Holt, Dereham, Fakenham, and Attleborough.&nbsp; At Yarmouth the
firm, until lately, comprised D. Gurney, J. H. Gurney, H.
Birkbeck, T. Brightwen, and J. H. Orde.&nbsp; This branch has in
its connection other branches at Lowestoft, Beccles, Bungay,
Halesworth, Saxmundham, Eye, and Stowmarket.&nbsp; At Lynn the
firm, until lately, comprised D. Gurney, J. H. Gurney, H. Gurney,
H. Birkbeck, S. Gurney, and F. G. Cresswell, and this bank
extends to Downham and Swaffham.</p>

<p>The Crown Bank, in King Street, Norwich, was opened on January
2nd, 1792, as a bank of deposit, discount, and issue.&nbsp; The
original proprietors were Messrs. Hudson and Hatfield, and the
first bank was in the Haymarket.&nbsp; About forty years since
the proprietors were Charles Saville Onley, Sir Robert John
Harvey, Anthony Hudson, and Thomas Hudson.&nbsp; They then
employed only seven clerks, and now thirty clerks are employed at
the new bank.&nbsp; On January 13th, 1820, a circular was issued
by A. and T. Hudson, stating that it was with great regret that
they announced the death of their friend and partner, Mr. Robert
Harvey.&nbsp; Owing to his death, his brother, Mr. Charles
Harvey, and Sir Robert John Harvey, his nephew, were added to the
firm.&nbsp; Before 1820, Mr. Onley withdrew.&nbsp; Mr. T. Hudson
and Mr. A. Hudson died, and before the <a
name="page598"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 598</span>end of the
Russian war, Sir Robert John Harvey died.&nbsp; The present
proprietors are Sir Robert John Harvey Harvey, Bart., Crown
Point, and Roger Allday Kerrison, Esq., who lives at
Ipswich.&nbsp; They have lately built a very handsome bank in the
Corinthian style of architecture, on the Castle Meadow, and it
was opened in January, 1866.&nbsp; At first the Crown Bank had
only three agents in the eastern counties, but the number has
gradually increased to thirty.&nbsp; The firm purchased the large
business of Messrs. Taylor and Dyson at Diss.&nbsp; This was an
important addition, the Diss bank having extensive connections in
Norfolk and Suffolk.</p>
<p>In 1806, Messrs. Starling Day and Sons were bankers, in
Pottergate Street, afterwards in the Market Place, in the court
adjoining the Chronicle Office; and on December 16th, 1825, the
bank stopped.&nbsp; In 1806, T. Bignold, Son, and Co. were
bankers in Briggs&rsquo; Street, but did not long continue in
business.&nbsp; The Norfolk and Norwich Joint Stock Bank was
established in 1820, in Surrey Street.&nbsp; This bank consisted
of a small proprietary, and the business, after the loss of the
whole share capital, was disposed of to the East of England Joint
Stock Company, in 1836.&nbsp; That company carried on business in
the Haymarket till 1864, when the bank failed.&nbsp; The sad
event was the cause of much misery in the city and county; and
many persons who had been in comfortable circumstances were
entirely ruined and left destitute.&nbsp; The proprietors lost
all their capital, and were called upon to liquidate heavy
liabilities besides.&nbsp; <a name="page599"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 599</span>There has not been much over trading
in the eastern counties, and the failure of the East of England
Bank should be a warning to other joint stock banks, which ought
to be the safest if well managed.&nbsp; The business of the East
of England Bank and the premises were purchased by the Provincial
Banking Corporation, limited, and that company now carries on
business in the Haymarket.</p>
<p>About 1838, Mr. Balls opened a bank for deposits, in the Upper
Market.&nbsp; He carried on his business through the house of
Sanderson in London.&nbsp; Sanderson failed for &pound;365,000,
but afterwards paid 20s. in the pound, and had &pound;20,000 to
spare.&nbsp; Mr. Balls gave up his bank in Norwich, in 1847.</p>
<p>The Consolidated Bank arose from a union of the banks of
Hankey and Co., and Hayward, Kennard, and Co., London, and the
bank of Manchester.&nbsp; They were amalgamated in 1863, under
the name of the Consolidated Bank, with a branch in London
Street, Norwich.&nbsp; The Company gave up this branch, and the
handsome new premises in London Street were taken by the National
Provincial Bank, which has been established since 1833.</p>
<p>Country banks are all of them banks of deposit and discount;
they act as agents for the remittance of money to and from
London, and for effecting payments between different parts of the
kingdom.&nbsp; Nearly all of them are also banks of issue, and
their notes are, in most cases, made payable to some bank in
London, as well as at the place where they are issued.&nbsp; A
moderate rate of interest, from 2 to 2&frac12; per cent, is <a
name="page600"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 600</span>allowed by
country bankers on deposits which remain with them for any period
beyond six months.&nbsp; Some make this allowance for shorter
periods.&nbsp; Where a depositor has also a drawing account, the
balance is struck every six months, and the interest due on the
average is placed to his credit.&nbsp; On drawing accounts, a
commission, usually an eighth per cent, is charged on all
payments.&nbsp; The country banker on his part pays his London
agent for the trouble which he occasions, either by keeping a
certain sum of money in his hands without interest, or by
allowing a commission on the payments made for his account, or by
a fixed annual payment in lieu of the same.&nbsp; The portion of
funds in their hands arising from deposits and issues, which is
not required for discounting bills and making advances in the
country, is invested in government or mercantile securities in
London, which in the event of a contraction of deposits, can be
made immediately available.</p>
<p>The agriculture of the eastern counties, the most productive
in England, is the foundation of their industrial prosperity, and
the chief source of business to the banks in the market
towns.&nbsp; It is well known that since the commencement of this
century, by means of an improved system of husbandry, the
agricultural resources of the district have greatly increased, as
has also the annual value of the produce in cattle, sheep,
horses, pigs, and corn.&nbsp; The various branches of industry
and manufactures carried on in Norwich and the county are also,
of course, to be reckoned amongst the sources of the banking
business.</p>
<h4><a name="page601"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
601</span><span class="smcap">Wholesale Clothiers</span>.</h4>
<p>Mr. Dyer, in White Lion Street; Messrs. Riches and Skoyles,
Davey Place; Mr. Womack, Dove Street and Lobster Lane; and
Messrs. Steward and Son, Tombland; occupy extensive premises,
where garments are made for men and boys by the use of machines,
and are disposed of wholesale to retail clothiers all over the
district.&nbsp; The introduction of sewing machines has given a
great impulse to this trade, and garments of all kinds and sizes
are produced here as good in quality and as low in price as they
can be obtained in any part of the kingdom.</p>
<p>A minute&rsquo;s walk from the Market Place, in Bethel Street,
are the steam clothing works and warehouses of Messrs. F. W.
Harmer and Co.&nbsp; Between 200 and 300 persons are employed by
this firm in the manufacture of boys&rsquo; and men&rsquo;s
clothing; their goods are sold wholesale only, and are made for
what is technically called the &ldquo;home trade.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
this establishment the different processes of cutting, sewing,
making button holes, &amp;c., which a few years since were
performed by hand labour, are now principally done by machinery
worked by steam power, to the advantage both of the hands
employed and the consumers of the goods.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Wholesale Boot and Shoe
Trade</span>.</h4>
<p>This trade dates from the commencement of the present century;
and for some time it was confined to goods for the home
market.&nbsp; In 1800, Mr. James <a name="page602"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 602</span>Smith began the trade, which was
afterwards enlarged by the late Mr. Charles Winter, who carried
on a great business, both for the home market and for exportation
to the colonies.&nbsp; On the death of that gentleman the concern
passed into the hands of Messrs. Willis and Southall, under whose
able management the reputation of the old house is fully
sustained, and whose goods command a ready sale both at home and
abroad.&nbsp; The quality of the goods is now much improved, and
large quantities are exported to the colonies.</p>
<p>Formerly, all boots and shoes were made by hand only, and
consequently there was a great difference in the quality of the
work.&nbsp; The operatives used to take their work to their
homes.&nbsp; They received so many dozen uppers from the
warehouses and returned them finished, and were paid according to
quality and quantity.&nbsp; The late Mr. C. Winter first made use
of sewing machines, for the uppers of boots and shoes, about
1856.&nbsp; Afterwards American machines were introduced, to sew
the soles to the uppers.</p>
<p>About eighteen years since, the manufacturers began to make
goods for exportation to Canada, to the Cape of Good Hope, to
India, and Australia.&nbsp; This export trade was carried on to a
large extent, from 1856 till 1866.&nbsp; Mr. C. Winter sent large
quantities of goods to Canada and India, and the other
manufacturers to Australia.&nbsp; A number of emigrants, however,
went into the trade in Australia, and the local parliament
imposed a duty of 25 per cent. on English-made goods, which
stopped the trade, so that <a name="page603"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 603</span>of late, very few Australian orders
have been received in this city.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this
drawback, the boot and shoe trade has become a very extensive and
important branch of industry in Norwich, and about 3000 hands are
employed in the manufacture.&nbsp; Hitherto it has been confined
chiefly to women and children&rsquo;s goods, but men&rsquo;s
boots have been made to some extent, and there is no reason why
the trade should not be greatly increased.&nbsp; Machines, as we
have said, have been introduced in the various processes of
manufacture, and steam power has been applied to the machines in
two large factories, where vast quantities of goods are
produced.&nbsp; The result has been not to diminish but to extend
the number of hands, and to increase the rate of payment.</p>
<p>The hand machines now in use are chiefly those of Thomas,
Singer, or Howes.&nbsp; About 400 machines are at work daily in
the warehouses, and 200 in private houses.&nbsp; In two
factories, large American machines are used for attaching the
soles to the uppers at the rate of a pair per minute.&nbsp; By
means of these machines, a pair of boots may be cut out, and the
uppers, after fitting, sewn together and finished in an hour; and
the work, moreover, is better done by the use of machines than it
usually is by hand.&nbsp; Three operatives are required for each
machine, two fitters and one machinist.</p>
<p>When trade is good, about 3000 men, women, and children, are
employed in the manufacture, either in the warehouses or in their
own homes.&nbsp; The operatives may be divided into one-third
men, one-third women, <a name="page604"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 604</span>and one-third children.&nbsp; They
will produce, with the aid of machines, about 1000 dozen pairs of
boots and shoes daily.&nbsp; The quantity will therefore be 6000
dozen weekly, and taking the average price at 40s. per dozen, the
value would be &pound;12,000 weekly.&nbsp; Supposing the trade to
continue brisk for fifty weeks in the year, the annual value
would be &pound;600,000.</p>
<p>During the year, 1868, trade was very prosperous, and
manufacturers received more orders than they could execute.&nbsp;
The quantities before stated may be doubled for that year; and at
least 6000 men, women, and children, were employed.&nbsp; Their
production, with the aid of machines, has been about 2000 dozen
pairs of boots and shoes daily, or 12,000 dozen pairs weekly, so
that the weekly value has been &pound;24,000, or &pound;1,200,000
yearly.&nbsp; Norwich does not transact a hundredth part of this
branch of trade in England, and, therefore, it may be increased
to an indefinite extent.</p>
<p>The principal firms in the trade in 1868, were Messrs.
Tillyard and Howlett, on St. George&rsquo;s Plain; Mr. Kemp, in
Pitt Street; Messrs. Willis and Southall, who occupy very
extensive premises in the Upper Market; Mr. Hotblack, St.
Faith&rsquo;s Lane; Mr. Lulham, Fishgate Street; Mr. Ford, St.
George Colegate; Mr. Homan, Theatre Street; Mr. Bostock, Swan
Lane; Mr. Steadman, Bethel Street; Messrs. Barker and Gostling,
Wensum Street; Mr. Haldenstein, Queen Street; Messrs. Gamble and
Davis, Calvert Street; Mr. Smith, Calvert Street; Mr. D. Soman,
Calvert Street; Mr. Base, in Prince&rsquo;s Street; Mr. Copeman,
<a name="page605"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 605</span>St.
Stephen&rsquo;s; Mr. Horne, Charing Cross; Mr. Worledge, Magdalen
Street.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Mustard, Starch, and Blue
Works</span>.</h4>
<p>The Carrow Works have been greatly extended since the brief
notice in the first part of this history was written, and we are
now enabled to give a fuller description.&nbsp; Messrs. J. and J.
Colman employ about 1200 men and boys in the production of
mustard, starch, blue, paper, and flour.&nbsp; By the use of
machinery of the most improved construction, and by selecting
seed of the finest quality, the firm produces mustard which
cannot be surpassed in purity and flavour.&nbsp; This mustard
obtained the only prize medals awarded for the article at the
Great Exhibition in London, 1862, and Dublin, 1865, and the only
silver medal at Paris, 1868.&nbsp; The firm also obtained medals
for starch at the Great Exhibitions in London, 1851 and 1862;
Dublin, 1865; York, 1866; and Paris, 1868.</p>
<p>Carrow Works are situated just outside of the King Street
Gates of the city, on the banks of the river Wensum, which is
navigable for vessels of about 120 tons.&nbsp; Lines of railway
are laid down in various directions through the premises
connecting all the principal warehouses with the Great Eastern
Railway at Trowse.&nbsp; Thus Messrs. Colman have every facility
for receiving the raw material, and for disposing of the
manufactured goods by land or water conveyance.&nbsp; The
machinery used is very extensive, and sixteen engines are now
employed, amounting altogether to 1000-horse power.</p>
<p><a name="page606"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 606</span>On
entering the works we pass the timekeeper&rsquo;s office, and
observe on the right hand a large range of brick buildings.&nbsp;
Here is the mustard mill, and amid all the noise within we are
shewn the process by which the well-known condiment, mustard, is
produced in such immense quantities, and in the greatest
perfection.&nbsp; The mustard seed, which is grown extensively in
some parts of this country, is crushed between iron rollers, and
is then pounded in large mortars, a long row of which stand on
one side of the mill.&nbsp; The pestles consist of long wooden
rods with heavy balls of iron.&nbsp; They are set in rapid motion
by means of steam power, and the mustard seed is speedily reduced
to the condition of flour and bran.&nbsp; These are readily
separated, and the flour is brought to the requisite quality by
means of silk sieves, which vary in fineness according to the
quality of the mustard to be produced.&nbsp; These sieves are
loosely arranged in frames, and set in motion by means of
revolving shafts.&nbsp; Two kinds of seed, the brown and the
white, are thus crushed, pounded, and sifted.&nbsp; The brown is
far more pungent than the white; but in order to produce a
flavour relished by consumers, it is necessary to mix these two
kinds, and it is the judicious mixture which gives the fine
aromatic flavour of the mustard for which the firm is
celebrated.</p>
<p>Adjoining the mustard mill is the packing floor, where a great
number of men and boys are employed in putting the mustard into
tins of various shapes and sizes, and adorning them with the
handsome labels which are so generally exhibited in
grocers&rsquo; windows <a name="page607"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 607</span>everywhere, for the demand for this
mustard is universal.</p>
<p>Leaving the mustard mill we enter the starch works, which seem
to be still more extensive.&nbsp; The process of making starch is
carefully explained to us.&nbsp; After the grain has been
moistened with a solution of caustic soda, it is passed into the
mill, where it is mixed with water and ground in its wet state
between mill stones; from each pair of which continually runs a
stream of pure white liquid, resembling thin paste.&nbsp; This
liquid is placed in large iron tanks called
&ldquo;separators,&rdquo; a considerable quantity of water is
added, and the whole is well stirred for some time.&nbsp; It is
then allowed to settle, and the various particles of husk,
gluten, &amp;c., sink slowly and form a thick deposit at the
bottom.&nbsp; The water with the starch in solution is then drawn
off and pumped up into immense shallow vats, several sets of
which, placed over one another, occupy the whole of the upper
part of the building.&nbsp; In the course of two or three days
the liquid in the shallow vats gradually deposits the starch held
in solution, when the water is drawn off, and the starch is taken
out and placed in long narrow boxes filled with holes and lined
with cloth.&nbsp; It remains in these boxes for some time in
order that the moisture may gradually drain out and the starch
consolidate.&nbsp; As soon as it is sufficiently hardened, the
starch is taken out and divided into blocks, each about six
inches square, and put into stoves and exposed to a temperature
of about 140 degrees; after which it is cleaned, papered, and
again placed in stoves, where it remains till it is <a
name="page608"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 608</span>gradually
crystallized, when the process of manufacture is complete, and
the starch is ready for sale.</p>
<p>We now walk across to the other side of the premises and enter
a long row of workshops, where a great number of men and boys are
employed in making tin-packages for the mustard.&nbsp; Passing by
long ranges of coopers and carpenters&rsquo; shops, we soon come
to a large square block of buildings called the &ldquo;blue
factory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the indigo is mixed with the finest
starch, water is added, and the whole is ground in a moist state
by large heavy mill stones, till it resembles a very thick, dark
blue paste.&nbsp; It is transferred by means of a steam hoist to
the upper part of the building, where it is received and quickly
manipulated by a number of girls, who divide it into small cakes
and stamp it with wooden stamps of various devices, from which it
is called &ldquo;Stamp Title,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lion,&rdquo; &amp;c.;
or they work it into balls, on which they leave the impressions
of their finger and thumb, when it is called &ldquo;Thumb
Blue.&rdquo;&nbsp; We learn from the workers that the great art
of blue making consists in drying it carefully, so that the lumps
or cakes may harden without cracking.&nbsp; We walk through many
rooms, almost in the dark, for the window shutters, which are
closed, are so constructed as to regulate the temperature, and we
have just room to pass between large tiers of racks filled with
wooden trays, on which the lumps and cakes of blue are placed in
order that they may dry gradually.</p>
<p>We next take a peep at the paper mill, and admire the
beautiful machinery which rapidly transforms any <a
name="page609"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 609</span>quantity of
dirty rags into a thin milk-like pulp, and then into solid quires
and reams of paper, all cut and ready for use.&nbsp; As we pass
we look into the engineers&rsquo; shop and wonder at the variety
of the machinery there, capable of operating on the hardest
steel, and of planing, cutting, punching, or drilling it with the
greatest apparent ease; and we learn that most of the machinery
is made and repaired on the premises.</p>
<p>We are at last taken to the luncheon kitchen, in which a good
lunch or dinner is provided, consisting of as much hot meat and
potatoes as any man can eat, for threepence.&nbsp; Many of the
men and boys gladly avail themselves of this kitchen, and obtain
a good meal without leaving the works.</p>
<p>On leaving the yard we ascend the hill and observe a handsome
school-house, built in the Gothic style, and we learn that it was
built by Messrs. J. and J. Colman for the children of the
working-people in their service.&nbsp; The school comprises
several class-rooms, and is fitted up with every convenience.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Iron Trade</span>.</h4>
<p>Coal and iron form the basis of our industrial system in this
island, but neither of them are produced in the eastern counties,
which are, for the most part, purely agricultural.&nbsp; Iron
manufactures have, however, arisen since the commencement of the
present century, chiefly for agricultural purposes.&nbsp; Norwich
cannot boast of concerns so extensive as Messrs. Ransome and
Sims, of Ipswich; or Messrs. <a name="page610"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 610</span>Garrett, of Leiston, in Suffolk; but
several firms here employ large numbers of mechanics in the
construction of engines, machines, and implements of every
sort.</p>
<p>Dr. William Fairbairn, in his &ldquo;History of Iron,&rdquo;
mentions five distinct epochs: the first dating from the
employment of an artificial blast, to accelerate combustion; the
second marked by the use of coke in the reduction, about the year
1750; the third dating from the introduction of the steam engine,
on account of the facilities which that invention has given for
raising the ores, pumping the mines, supplying the furnace with a
copious and regular blast, and moving the powerful forge, and
rolling machinery; while the fourth is indicated by the
introduction of the system of puddling and rolling; and the fifth
and last&mdash;though not the least important epoch in the
history of iron, is marked by the application of the hot blast,
an invention which has increased the production of iron
four-fold, and has enabled the iron-master to smelt otherwise
useless and unreducible ores.&nbsp; It has abolished the
processes of coking and roasting, and has afforded facilities for
a large and rapid production, far beyond the most sanguine
anticipations of its inventors.&nbsp; Some manufacturers, taking
advantage of so powerful an agent, have used improper materials,
such as cinder heaps and impure ores, and by unduly hastening the
process, have produced an inferior kind of iron.</p>
<p>Nearly all the iron manufacturers in Norwich, Norfolk, and
Suffolk, are founders, and make their own <a
name="page611"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 611</span>castings
for engines, girders, and machines of every kind.&nbsp; The
principal firms in this district are Messrs. Ransome and Sims,
before named; Messrs. Garrett, of Leiston; Mr. Turner, Ipswich;
Messrs. Woods, Cocksedge, and Warner, Stowmarket; Mr. C. Burrell,
of Thetford; and Messrs. Barnard, Bishop, &amp; Barnard, Mr. W.
S. Boulton, Mr. Smithdale, and Messrs. Holmes and Sons, of
Norwich.&nbsp; These great firms send their productions all over
the civilised world.</p>
<p>The important works of Messrs. Barnard, Bishop, and Barnard,
of Norwich, are situate in St. Michael&rsquo;s Coslany, and cover
an area of one acre, next the river Wensum.&nbsp; Entering from
Coslany Street, the new counting house is joined on the right by
a suite of offices, and on the left by the smith&rsquo;s shop,
which is backed by fire-proof workshops, seventy-five feet in
length, and five stories in height.&nbsp; The large foundry is at
the east end of the works.&nbsp; A tramway runs from Coslany
Street into the interior, permeating the premises.&nbsp; About
400 men and boys are employed in the production of wire-netting,
fencing, garden chairs, stands, machines, lawn mowers, gates, and
every kind of horticultural implements.&nbsp; A glance at the
operations of the firm will, doubtless, be interesting to our
readers.&nbsp; One of the most important is the production daily
of many miles of wire-netting, made by curious machinery.&nbsp;
The strained wire fencing is made on the best principle, the
bases of both the straining pillars and standards being entirely
of iron; and after a test of more than thirty years, it has been
found very superior, both as regards durability and
appearance.&nbsp; Messrs. Barnard, <a name="page612"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 612</span>Bishop, and Barnard are also makers,
on a large scale, of bedsteads, mangles, cooking ranges,
kitcheners, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>This firm, the founder of which was Mr. Charles Barnard, a man
of modest demeanour, but possessed of considerable inventive
genius, will live in history as the manufacturers of the
celebrated &ldquo;Norwich Gates,&rdquo; exhibited in 1862.&nbsp;
These were designed by Mr. Thomas Jekyll of this city, and by a
county subscription were, in November, 1864, placed at the
entrance to the park at Sandringham, the residence of the Prince
of Wales.&nbsp; During the Exhibition of 1862, these marvellous
productions attracted great attention.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i>, of
April 7th, after alluding to works of a similar character,
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In our judgment, however, the design of
these latter is scarcely equal to that of the beautiful
wrought-iron park gates, which are being erected, as a principal
nave trophy, by Messrs. Barnard, Bishop, and Barnard.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were adjudged to be the best in the Exhibition.&nbsp;
The same firm also produced very elegant gates, which were
exhibited at the Paris Exhibition, in 1867, and greatly admired
for the beauty of the design and perfect workmanship.&nbsp; These
gates were only thirteen feet wide, and seven feet in height, but
they occupied forty of the best workmen from morning till night
for three months, at a cost of &pound;750 in wages.&nbsp; These
gates were quite unique in design and workmanship.&nbsp; There
was not a touch of the chisel.&nbsp; The hammer did all the work
in the most perfect manner.</p>
<p><a name="page613"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 613</span>In
conclusion, we may state, that after a minute examination of the
productions at these works, we feel convinced that articles can
now be executed in metal, which surpass the doings of past ages;
and that the labour, combined with the intelligence of this 19th
century, when skilfully directed, is quite equal to that of the
medi&aelig;val period.</p>
<p>Mr. W. S. Boulton, who occupies extensive premises in Rose
Lane, is a manufacturer of agricultural and horticultural
implements; also of strained wire fencing, iron hurdles, park
gates, garden chairs, iron bedsteads, kitchen ranges, hot-water
appuratus, &amp;c.&nbsp; He produces every kind of railing and
palisading in great variety, and he put up the iron palisading
round Chapel Field, which is a great ornament as well as
protection to the ground.&nbsp; He also supplies a great variety
of useful machines, such as mincing and sausage machines, and
almost all articles made of iron.</p>
<p>Messrs. Riches and Watts are engineers and machine makers, at
Duke&rsquo;s Palace Iron Works.&nbsp; They are builders of
condensing engines, vertical cylinder engines, and steam
thrashing machines; and are also makers of American grist mills,
corn mills, mills for grinding linseed, &amp;c., cultivators,
pumping machinery, iron field rollers, and all kinds of
implements.</p>
<p>Messrs. Holmes and Sons, engineers, on the Castle Hill, are
makers of a great variety of machines and implements which have
gained many prizes at different Agricultural Exhibitions.&nbsp;
The firm have also been very extensively engaged for thirty-five
years in the manufacture of drills.&nbsp; During this period,
every <a name="page614"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
614</span>practical improvement has been introduced, adapting
them to every description of soil, simplifying the different
parts, and decreasing the working expenses for the renewal of
wearing parts.&nbsp; These drills stand unequalled for
simplicity, durability, and efficiency, and are of lighter draft
than others, owing to the position of the coulters and
levers.&nbsp; More than 4000 of these drills have been sent
out.&nbsp; The premises of this firm are well situated close to
the cattle market, and have been considerably enlarged.&nbsp; The
new show rooms in the Market are nearly opposite to the entrance
to the Castle.&nbsp; Entering the works from the high road, we
may first inspect the foundry, containing an enormous crane and
three cupolas.&nbsp; Adjoining the foundry are the stoves for
small castings, and above it the pattern-makers&rsquo;
shop.&nbsp; Returning to the yard, we may enter the erecting and
fitting shop.&nbsp; The drill-fitting shop and the
thrashing-machine shops are admirably adapted for their intended
purposes.&nbsp; About a hundred hands are employed in the
works.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Smithdale has a very large establishment at St.
Ann&rsquo;s Staithe, King Street, on the site of an ancient
monastery, remains of which still exist next the river.&nbsp; In
the large foundry, castings of iron are made, up to ten tons; and
the workshops contain the heaviest machinery in Norwich.&nbsp;
Mr. Smithdale builds engines from three to a hundred horse power;
and he makes also hydraulic presses, cranes, crabs, mill works,
planing, shaping, and drilling machines, and boilers of all
sizes.</p>
<p>Mr. Reeve, in Pitt Street, is a manufacturer of improved <a
name="page615"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 615</span>kitchen
ranges of various sizes, which have been in great demand.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Manufacturing Publishers</span>.</h4>
<p>Messrs. Jarrold and Sons have, for the last twenty years, been
engaged in the production of first-class educational books, in
science, history, and penmanship, which are used in schools in
Great Britain and her Colonies.&nbsp; They also produced the
well-known Household Tracts and other works, bearing on social,
moral, and sanitary subjects.&nbsp; All are printed and bound in
their recently-erected workshops in Little London Street.&nbsp;
They have also a publishing house at No. 12, Paternoster Row,
London.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Wine</span>, <span
class="smcap">Spirits</span>, <span class="smcap">and
Beer</span>.</h4>
<p>Norwich merchants carry on a great wholesale business in wines
and spirits.&nbsp; The principal firms are Messrs. Barwell and
Sons, London Street and St. Stephen&rsquo;s; Messrs. Norgate and
Son, St. Stephen&rsquo;s; Messrs. Geldart, in Wensum Street; the
Wine Company, in St. Giles&rsquo; Street; Mr. P. Back, Market
Place; Mr. R. J. Morley, Post Office Street; and Mr. J.
Chamberlin, Post Office Street; all of whom keep large stocks of
wines and spirits.</p>
<p>The brewing business is greatly extending in Norwich.&nbsp;
Norwich brewers produce pale ales, which claim to be equal to the
Burton, and dispose of 100,000 barrels of London porter
yearly.&nbsp; Messrs. Seaman and Grimmer, though not producers,
do an enormous trade, and bring in, through Yarmouth, <a
name="page616"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 616</span>about
14,000 barrels of London porter yearly, and send them all over
the city and county.</p>
<p>Messrs. Patteson and Co. produce 100,000 barrels of ale and
beer yearly; Messrs. Bullard, 60,000 barrels; Messrs. Morgan,
30,000; Messrs. Young and Co., and other brewers, about
40,000.&nbsp; The annual value of their productions is at least
&pound;500,000.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Wholesale Drapery</span>.</h4>
<p>This trade is largely carried on by Messrs. Chamberlin &amp;
Sons, Mr. G. L. Coleman, Mr. Rackham, Mr. Henry Snowdon, and a
branch house of Messrs. Copestake and Moore, of London.&nbsp;
Their trade is in cotton, linen, woollen, and silk goods, plain
and fancy fabrics, which are supplied to shopkeepers all over the
eastern counties.&nbsp; They bring goods from all the
manufacturing districts, and supply them on terms quite as
advantageous as the London houses.&nbsp; These goods are chiefly
of Scotch, Yorkshire, or Lancashire manufactures, and not
produced in Norwich.</p>
<p>Messrs. Chamberlin and Sons, a few years since, rebuilt their
premises in the Market Place, which are an ornament to the
city.&nbsp; This is the largest establishment for drapery in the
eastern counties.&nbsp; On entering the premises from the Market
Place, the retail department presents, in all its arrangements, a
thoroughly complete place of business.&nbsp; The wholesale and
other departments above are very extensive.&nbsp; In the basement
of the premises is the wholesale Manchester room, 180 feet in
length, for linen goods, blankets, and <a
name="page617"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
617</span>flannels.&nbsp; There is a separate entrance, in Dove
Street, to the extensive woollen cloth department.&nbsp; The
carpet room is 44 feet long and 40 feet wide.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Wholesale Grocery</span>.</h4>
<p>The wholesale grocery trade is carried on to a large extent by
Messrs. Bream and Bennett, Mr. W. Belding, Messrs. Butcher and
Nephew, Messrs. Copeman and Sons, Mr. H. Freeman, Mr. R. Fisher,
Messrs. Newson and Co., and Messrs. Pratt and Hancock.&nbsp; This
trade disposes of the bulk of the heavy goods brought to the city
and sent away from it.&nbsp; The following is the return of the
goods, inwards and outwards, for the year ending June,
1867:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cigars and Tobacco</span>.</h4>
<p>The manufacture of tobacco was introduced into Norwich in 1815
by Mr. Curr, formerly of St. Andrew&rsquo;s.&nbsp; <a
name="page618"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 618</span>Since then
the trade has gradually increased, and the various kinds of shag,
twist, and cavendish, are now produced to the extent of between
100,000 and 200,000 lbs. yearly, by Mr. Newbegin of Bridewell
Alley, and Mr. Kitton on the Dereham Road.</p>
<p>The only cigar manufacturers are Messrs. Adcock and Denham, of
Post Office Street, and Mr. Stevens, Back of the Inns.&nbsp;
Messrs. Adcock and Denham, are the largest makers in the Eastern
Counties, and employ a considerable number of hands.&nbsp; At
their establishment may be seen tobacco from various countries,
and the curious enquirer will learn, no doubt with surprise, how
many distant spots of the earth are laid under contribution to
supply the demand which exists for the fragrant weed in the form
of cigars&mdash;the importations being, amongst other places,
from Columbia, Cuba, Havanna (in Cuba), Japan, Latakia, Manilla,
Mexico, Paraguay, Porto Rico, &amp;c.&nbsp; The operations, too,
are interesting, though not easily described.&nbsp; From the case
or bale in which the tobacco arrives, it passes into the hands of
the person whose duty it is to soften it&mdash;a process which
requires great skill and care; for the leaf is generally dry and
brittle, and has to be shaken and well separated before the
softening can be properly effected.&nbsp; The leaf, having been
rendered sufficiently pliable, is next passed over to the
&ldquo;strippers,&rdquo; whose work is to draw out the thick stem
which traverses it from end to end.&nbsp; Then it has to be
sorted&mdash;the light from the dark, the coarse from the
fine&mdash;and laid in proper order for the &ldquo;makers,&rdquo;
who with almost magical rapidity, and <a name="page619"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 619</span>by the exercise of great nicety of
judgment and manipulation, convert it into cigars of any required
size, shape, and weight.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Upholstery</span>.</h4>
<p>There are several large workshops in this city, for the
manufacture of every kind of furniture and cabinet work; and in
these, some hundreds of skilled artisans are employed.&nbsp;
Among the principal establishments may be mentioned those of
Messrs. Trevor &amp; Page, Post Office Street; Mr. C. J. Freeman,
in London Street; Messrs. John Crowe and Sons, in St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Street; Messrs. Robertson and Sons, Queen Street;
and Messrs. Drew and Corrick, in St. George&rsquo;s Middle
Street.&nbsp; All these establishments supply the best articles
for furnishing a house or mansion.&nbsp; The historian who might
wish to describe the familiar habits and usages of the present
times, could not do better than spend a few hours in our large
upholstery warehouses, where may be seen every kind of furniture,
from articles which contribute to our homeliest comforts, to
others which please the eye by their beauty and good taste.&nbsp;
These may be found grouped together in profusion, making the
impression on the mind that this must be a wealthy district to
require the vast stores of goods kept in Norwich warehouses; but
so it is, as every one knows who has visited the dwellings of
many of our rich citizens.&nbsp; Luxuries are enjoyed by the
well-to-do classes of to-day, which could not be found in
baronial halls a few centuries ago.</p>
<h4><a name="page620"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
620</span><span class="smcap">Carriage Manufactures</span>.</h4>
<p>There are several large builders of carriages, gigs, carts,
phaetons, &amp;c., in this city, including Messrs. Jolly and Son,
St. Stephen&rsquo;s Street; Mr. Thorn, St. Giles&rsquo; Gates;
Messrs. Howes, Chapel Field; Mr. Harcourt, Chapel-Field Road;
Messrs. J. and J. Howes, Red Lion Street; Mr. W. H. Howes, Prince
of Wales&rsquo; Road; Mr. Rudling, St. Martin&rsquo;s at
Palace.&nbsp; Mr. Thorn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Norwich Car&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Norfolk Shooting Cart&rdquo; are well known all over
England.&nbsp; Messrs. Jolly build every sort of useful and fancy
vehicle in the best possible style.&nbsp; We cannot here pretend
to tell how much the construction of carriages has been improved
in the present century, as compared with the old lumbering
vehicles formerly in use.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that by the
application of science, English carriages have become the best in
all the world.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Brushes and Paper Bags</span>.</h4>
<p>Messrs. S. D. Page and Sons have built a large warehouse in
the Haymarket, where they employ upwards of 100 hands in the
manufacture of brushes for wholesale trade.&nbsp; They are also
extensively engaged in the paper trade and in the manufacture of
paper bags by very interesting and curious machinery worked by
steam power, and by which each bag is pasted, folded, cut, and
completed in the machine with astonishing rapidity.&nbsp; Three
such machines, and several hands, are employed.&nbsp; The bags
are made of various sizes and qualities of paper, adapted for the
general use of grocers, drapers, confectioners, &amp;c.</p>
<h4><a name="page621"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
621</span><span class="smcap">Flour Mills</span>.</h4>
<p>Besides the steam flour mills at Carrow works, which produce
about 1500 sacks of flour weekly, there are mills in St.
Swithin&rsquo;s and Hellesdon, which also produce enormous
quantities.&nbsp; Messrs. Barber and Sons are the owners of the
water mills at Hellesdon, and the steam flour mills in St.
Swithin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The old water mills in St.
Swithin&rsquo;s, the property of the corporation, are in the
occupation of Mr. Wells, and are in active operation.&nbsp; There
are also many wind mills in the neighbourhood, and water mills
abound.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Paper Manufacture</span>.</h4>
<p>This business is carried on, as before stated, at Carrow
works, but the largest mills are at Taverham, a few miles from
Norwich.&nbsp; At these mills, vast quantities of paper are
produced yearly, of various kinds and qualities, including broad
sheets for several influential newspapers.&nbsp; The trade has
been greatly increased since the repeal of the duty on paper; but
the increase here is nothing to what it has been elsewhere, since
the daily newspapers have reached a circulation of hundreds of
thousands per day.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Soap Trade</span>.</h4>
<p>Another branch of business, arising from productive industry,
is that in soap, of which Mr. Andrews, of Fishgate Street, is a
large manufacturer.&nbsp; Within the Norwich Excise Collection,
there are several soap makers, who produce immense quantities of
an article <a name="page622"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
622</span>which is used in the silk, woollen, linen, and cotton
manufactures, as well as for domestic purposes.&nbsp; About
300,000,000 lbs. are produced yearly in the Norwich Excise
district.&nbsp; The repeal of the duty upon this useful article
must have greatly increased the consumption.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Coal Trade</span>.</h4>
<p>About a dozen Norwich merchants carry on a considerable trade
in coal.&nbsp; They receive coal inward by river 70,000 tons, by
railway 62,000 tons; in all, 132,000 tons annually.&nbsp; The
conveyance, at 6s. 8d. per ton, will be &pound;44,000; and the
total value, at 20s. per ton, will be &pound;132,000.&nbsp; The
principal merchants are Messrs. J. and H. Girling, Mr. Dawbarn,
Mr. Pointer, Mr. Coller, Mr. Jewson, and others, who now bring
coal by railway from the central coal fields.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Cattle Food and Manure</span>.</h4>
<p>A very extensive business in artificial food for cattle has
sprung up of late years, but as yet there are only two or three
firms engaged in the trade in Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. John Ketton has
mills near Foundry Bridge, where he produces about 200 tons of
cake weekly, for fattening cattle.&nbsp; The linseed or other
seed is crushed by immense circular stones, turned by ingenious
machinery.&nbsp; The oil, thus squeezed out, is of great value,
and the refuse is made into cake for fattening cattle, and sold
at &pound;8 per ton.&nbsp; The oil is of equal value.&nbsp;
Messrs. Gayford, Kitton, and Co., have mills at St. Ann&rsquo;s
<a name="page623"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 623</span>Staithe,
King Street, and produce 100 tons of cake weekly.&nbsp; These two
firms, therefore, produce about 300 tons of cake weekly, or
15,600 tons yearly, the whole value being &pound;124,800.&nbsp;
The oil being of equal value, the total trade amounts to
&pound;250,000 a year.&nbsp; Other city merchants, not producers,
send away about 100 tons a-week.</p>
<p>The late Mr. William Stark, of this city, was an eminent
chemist, and the first who produced bone manures.&nbsp; His son,
Mr. M. I. Stark, continues the same manufacture of manures, made
from steamed bones under a process by which all their gelatinous
and fertilizing properties are converted into the most suitable
form for application to the land.&nbsp; He also produces large
quantities of cake, made from linseed and beans.&nbsp; This new
article of artificial food has given great satisfaction.&nbsp;
The mills are at Duke&rsquo;s Palace Bridge, Norwich, and
Rockland St. Mary.&nbsp; Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Parker also produce
other kinds of artificial manure in large quantities.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Cattle and Corn</span>.</h4>
<p>These trades properly belong to the county, but the
transactions in the city are on a large scale.&nbsp; The cattle
trade is the great trade in the eastern counties, and more
especially of Norfolk.&nbsp; A vast amount of it is transacted on
the Castle Hill, greatly to the benefit of the city, as it gives
employment to a large number of poor people, and brings custom to
many inns, taverns, and business establishments.&nbsp; Norwich
Cattle Market is now one of the largest in England, taking <a
name="page624"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 624</span>the whole
year round, and it is rapidly increasing.&nbsp; The following
returns show the extent of the trade in the city and
county.&nbsp; The traffic at Trowse Station, from June 1866 to
June 1867, was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Most of these animals are brought to or sent away from Norwich
Market.</p>
<p>There are twenty acres of layers belonging to the railway
company round Trowse Station, and about one hundred acres of
layers close by belonging to private parties.&nbsp; These layers
are generally covered with cattle and sheep during the season,
from August till November.&nbsp; The valleys of the Yare, the
Bure, and the Waveney, afford almost unlimited pastures for any
number of cattle and sheep, and the greater part of the lean
stock sold on Norwich Hill are brought to be fattened on those
pastures.&nbsp; In short, the cattle trade on the Great Eastern
lines has been greatly increasing, and is now the largest on any
system of railways in England.</p>
<p>Norfolk ranks the fourth in extent, as compared with other
counties in England, and eighth as regards population; and it is
well known, that since the commencement of this century, the
resources of the county, in regard to the production of corn,
have <a name="page625"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
625</span>been greatly increased by an improved system of
husbandry.&nbsp; Over a million acres are under cultivation,
including 200,000 acres of commons and sandy heaths, which have
been inclosed of late years.&nbsp; In 1831, the average yield of
wheat was three quarters per acre; but there has been an increase
of thirty per cent, since that period.</p>
<p>According to the inspector&rsquo;s returns of sales of corn in
the Norwich Exchange, the quantities and prices have varied
greatly in different years, since 1845.&nbsp; In the year ending
October 11th, 1845, the quantity of wheat sold was 150,226 qrs.,
but after the repeal of the corn laws, the quantity was gradually
reduced to the year ending October 3rd, 1868, when it was 65,903
qrs.&nbsp; Since 1855, the quantity of barley sold yearly has
varied from 120,000 to 177,000 qrs.; and in the year ending
October 3rd, 1868, it was 166,796 qrs.&nbsp; Average prices per
qr. for 1868.&nbsp; Wheat, 66/9&frac12;.&nbsp; Barley,
42/8&frac14;.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Carrying Trade</span>.<br />
(<i>By water</i>.)</h4>
<p>The river Wensum flows for a distance of 30 miles from Rudham
to Norwich, and winding round the city, flows into the Yare at
Trowse.&nbsp; The Yare winds through the eastern division of the
county for 36 miles to Yarmouth.&nbsp; The Waveney flows into the
Yare at Reedham, and the Bure at Yarmouth.&nbsp; The three
rivers, Yare, Bure, and Waveney, are 200 miles in length, and
afford means of water conveyance from the city and all parts of
East Norfolk to Yarmouth <a name="page626"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 626</span>haven.&nbsp; The inhabitants of that
town have made no fewer than seven havens, one after the other,
at a cost of millions of money,&mdash;enough to have formed the
piers and quays of solid granite.</p>
<p>We have already given an account of the proceedings of the
corporation of Norwich respecting the improvement of the
navigation from this city to Yarmouth and Lowestoft, between 1820
and 1840, and, therefore, will not go over the same ground
again.&nbsp; We need only add that the improvement has been
continued both by the authorities of Yarmouth and Lowestoft, that
the channel over Breydon has been deepened to seven feet at low
water, and that a handsome bridge has been built at Yarmouth,
allowing of the free ebb and flow of the tidal waters.&nbsp; The
harbour at Lowestoft has also been kept open, and the navigation
from that port to the city is still carried on by means of
wherries and other vessels.&nbsp; These wherries are peculiar to
the rivers of Norfolk and Suffolk, and those used on the Yare
carry from fifteen to forty tons, drawing from three to four feet
of water.&nbsp; The mast is balanced by means of lead, so that
one man can raise and lower it, and on this the sail is hoisted,
being extended by a gaff.&nbsp; These vessels are well adapted
for the windings of the stream, and are generally navigated by
two hands, one of them being often a boy, or the wife of a
waterman.&nbsp; The corporation has jurisdiction on the river
from Hellesdon Bridge to Hardley Cross, a distance of twenty-four
miles.&nbsp; This, however, does not interfere with the rights of
landowners on the banks, all of whom have <a
name="page627"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 627</span>their
respective free fisheries, &amp;c.&nbsp; Ten bridges cross the
river in its passage through the city and its suburbs.</p>
<p>Norwich and Yarmouth must ever be united in the carrying trade
by water, as the river Yare flows into the sea.&nbsp; From the
statements already made, it will be seen that for centuries past
Yarmouth has been the chief port of the city and county; that
from the city, and various towns in East Norfolk, vast quantities
of goods have been annually conveyed along the Yare, Bure, and
Waveney, to that port, to be thence shipped to all parts of
England; and that Norwich merchants have brought in the larger
proportion of their goods <i>vi&acirc;</i> Yarmouth.</p>
<p>In 1866, an act, the 29 and 30 Victoria, c 242, was passed for
&ldquo;the conservanity and improvement of the port and haven of
Great Yarmouth, and the rivers connected therewith, also for the
levying and abolishing of tolls and duties, and for other
purposes.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the last Yarmouth Port and Haven
Act, and under it, the tolls have been increased on all vessels
coming to Norwich.&nbsp; By clause 144, it was enacted that,
&ldquo;From and after the 25th day of March, 1867, all monies
received from time to time by the Norwich corporation in respect
of the Norwich tolls, shall be applied by that corporation as
follows:&mdash;First, in payment of interest on the &pound;4000
secured on the Norwich tolls, or so much thereof as from time to
time remains secured thereon; and after and subject to that
payment.&nbsp; Secondly, in payment of a compensation to the
Norwich corporation for the abandonment and cesser of the Norwich
tolls, during the term of seven years, <a
name="page628"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 628</span>commencing
on the 25th day of March, 1867, in sums decreasing &pound;100
yearly, from &pound;700 to &pound;100.&nbsp; Thirdly, on payment
of the principal of the mortgage debts of &pound;4000, or of so
much thereof as from time to time remains secured on the Norwich
tolls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, the Norwich tolls will be extinguished in seven years
from March, 1867; in 1874.</p>
<h4>(<i>By Road and Rail</i>.)</h4>
<p>Roads and railways are as necessary as rivers for the carrying
trade, and even more so.&nbsp; Formerly, roads were the chief
means of transit, and the great roads in the eastern counties
were among the best in England.&nbsp; The Romans made all the
great roads from Norwich to Ipswich, Colchester, and London; also
from Norwich to Newmarket and London; and many others.</p>
<p>After the commencement of the railway system, the merchants of
Norwich and other towns felt that they must be placed on an
equality with other parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; Various lines of
railways were therefore projected; acts of parliament were
obtained; and the Eastern Counties from London to Colchester, the
Eastern Union from Colchester to Ipswich and thence to Norwich;
the Norfolk from Yarmouth; Norwich to Brandon and thence to
London; and the East Anglian lines, were made and opened.&nbsp;
Afterwards the East Suffolk line was opened from Yarmouth to
Beccles, Bungay, and Ipswich.&nbsp; The Norfolk line was opened
in 1845, and caused an entire change in the carrying trade of the
district.&nbsp; The quantity of goods <a name="page629"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 629</span>sent along the line to London was
soon 100,000 tons yearly, and great quantities were sent by way
of Ely and Peterborough to the large towns in the north of
England, from which also goods are brought to Norwich.&nbsp; It
is evident, therefore, that a vast amount of traffic, by sea or
land, was transferred to the railway.&nbsp; Goods which, prior to
the opening of the line were forwarded by road from Norwich into
the interior of the county, were sent by railway as far as
Thetford, and thus escaped the tonnage dues; and when the branch
lines were opened from Lowestoft to Beccles and Reedham, and from
Wymondham to Dereham, Fakenham and Wells, there was a still
greater diversion of the traffic.&nbsp; Large quantities of coal
were sent by railway direct to Dereham, which soon became a
dep&ocirc;t for central Norfolk.&nbsp; From all the towns along
its course, the new line took the greater part of the carrying
trade.&nbsp; It was soon a prosperous line, and proved to be of
great commercial advantage to the city.</p>
<p>The opening of all the new lines immediately caused coaches to
be discontinued, and threw a deal of shipping out of employment
at Yarmouth, Lynn, and Wells.&nbsp; By railways large quantities
of corn and malt were sent to various towns that used to be sent
by sea.&nbsp; Goods, too, from all parts of the north of England
were brought by railway into Norfolk and Norwich.&nbsp; For a
long time the chief part of the salt of England was produced in
Cheshire and sent down the river Weaver, which flows into the
Mersey at Liverpool, whence it was transhipped to Yarmouth, <a
name="page630"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 630</span>where the
consumption is immense, not less than 10,000 tons yearly being
used for curing fish.&nbsp; The greater part of the salt then
used in the eastern district was sent from Yarmouth through
Norfolk and Suffolk by river conveyance; but since the opening of
the line from Ely to Peterborough, large quantities have been
sent by railway from Stoke Works, in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire,
to any station along the lines at the rate of a penny per ton per
mile.&nbsp; Thus large supplies of salt have been brought to the
city and county.&nbsp; What has taken place in regard to the
trade in salt is only one example of what has occurred in
reference to the trade in any other kind of heavy goods.&nbsp;
The Norfolk main line was not laid out so much with a view to the
through traffic from any town to London, as to catch the traffic
from the city and county to the Midland and Northern Counties, by
way of Ely and Peterborough; and this object was completely
attained, greatly to the advantage of the city and county.</p>

IV.<br />
POLITICAL, ECCLESIASTICAL, RELIGIOUS, &amp; EDUCATIONAL</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
Political History.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have already recorded the chief
political events of the last century, and we shall now proceed to
connect it with the present period by a brief review of political
meetings and elections.&nbsp; An account of all the contested
elections, in full detail, would be highly interesting if it
could be written, but unfortunately the local records are very
imperfect and unreliable.&nbsp; The public journals have been, of
course, biassed by party considerations, and from them it is
impossible to derive an impartial account.</p>
<p>The English parliament has now attained the patriarchal age of
600 years.&nbsp; The latest researches confirm the conclusions of
the earlier historians, that <a name="page635"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 635</span>the year 1265 is the date of the
first regal summons convoking the great council of the nation, at
least in its complete form, on a muster of lords, spiritual and
temporal, knights of the shire, and representatives of cities and
boroughs; and throughout the whole sexcentenary period which has
elapsed, the estates of the realm have been convened at frequent
intervals to advise the sovereign on national affairs.&nbsp;
Parliament gradually effected great advances in the cause of
liberty; for, at the time of granting taxes and aids, they
generally coupled such concessions with important provisions for
the good of their fellow-citizens and the community at large.</p>
<p>Henry IV. directed a writ to the bailiffs by which four
citizens of Norwich were ordered to be returned to Parliament;
but, the attendance of members being then <i>paid for by their
constituents</i>, the expense was an object, and they therefore
made interest to get the members reduced to two only.&nbsp; Under
the old charters of the city the freemen were entitled to vote
for members of parliament and members of the corporation; and
householders were not included in the list of voters till the
Reform Act of 1832.&nbsp; The old freemen, therefore, formed the
greater part of the constituency, and in the course of time
became a very corrupt body here, as well as in all other
corporate towns.&nbsp; By the act of 1729, it was provided
&ldquo;that at every election for burgesses in parliament, every
one that votes must swear that he hath been admitted to his
freedom twelve calendar months before that election, and that he
hath not been polled at that <a name="page636"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 636</span>election before, or in case of an
election of two members, but for one person.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Reform Act of 1832, however, extended the franchise to &pound;10
householders in towns, and gave them a preponderating power in
parliament.</p>
<p>For many centuries the House of Commons represented only the
landed interest, and nearly all laws were in favour of the
land-owners, who, under pretence of protecting native industry,
enacted laws to prevent or to limit the importation of foreign
corn.&nbsp; The great land-owners in the House of Lords had their
nominees, too, in the House of Commons, and ruled the entire
country.</p>
<p>The first Revolution in France produced a wonderful effect on
the political and religious worlds.&nbsp; In the year 1790
commenced those great and important events in France, which laid
the foundation of the long war that afterwards raged between that
unfortunate empire and this country, and which almost ruined
Norwich.&nbsp; Party spirit here began to rage with increased
violence.&nbsp; The Tories were vehemently against the
Revolution, and the Whigs were equally earnest in its
favour.&nbsp; It is well known, indeed, that the unparalleled
convulsions on the continent extended their influence to England
and Scotland, and raised a storm, although not so disastrous, yet
scarcely less permanent.&nbsp; The jealousies of government had
been excited to an unreasonable height, and the suspension of the
Habeas Corpus Act furnished the ministers with an opportunity of
gratifying all their revenge on political opponents.&nbsp;
England, in short, by the base, <a name="page637"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 637</span>suspicious, and mean conduct of her
rulers, became for a short time the land of persecution and
oppression.&nbsp; Many of the most respectable men were
imprisoned on frivolous charges, while others were accused of
high treason; and though acquitted by juries, yet imprisonment
injured their health, distressed their families, and exhausted
their property.&nbsp; These disgraceful transactions continued
for some time, and roused a strong feeling of indignation against
the government of the day.</p>
<p>Mr. Mark Wilks, a Baptist preacher in this city, of whose
history we have already given some extensive details (see p.
482), made himself very prominent as an advocate of the
Revolution, and of radical principles.&nbsp; On July 14th, 1791,
he preached two political discourses, before crowded
congregations, in defence of the Revolution in France, and these
discourses had a marked effect in the city; and he became a very
active political partizan, both in the city and county.&nbsp; He
took a great interest in Hardy and his associates, who had become
involved in debt by the great expenses of their trial.&nbsp; He
instituted a subscription in all parts of the kingdom to assist
the sufferers; and on April 19th, 1795, he preached two sermons
in Norwich, in which he exposed with great severity the injustice
of the measures adopted against them, and vindicated their
characters and conduct.&nbsp; The collections, after the sermons,
amounted to a large sum.&nbsp; In one of his sermons, he
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In favour of Mr. Windham&rsquo;s acquitted
felons, (Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke, Bonney, Kidd, Joyce,
Holcroft, <a name="page638"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
638</span>Richton, and Baxter, and all their supposed associates
in guilt), we may adduce their peaceable and orderly demeanour in
all their public and private transactions.&nbsp; By whatever
names men are called, whether loyalists or republicans, whether
Reevites or Jacobins, I will venture to say that friends of
anarchy are foes of society, and ought to be considered as wolves
scattering the shepherd&rsquo;s flock, and dealt with
accordingly.&nbsp; But have we seen one atom of licentious
wantonness, one spark of civil discord in these friends of
reform?&nbsp; No! the peaceable and orderly deportment of these
societies has been sufficient to convince every unprejudiced mind
how much they have acted under the influence of that wisdom which
cometh from above, which is in its nature peaceable, and
productive of good fruits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jacobins in this city&mdash;and except at Paris
there can have been none greater&mdash;have given repeated
demonstrations of their love of peace.&nbsp; At a time when the
starving poor felt an iniquitous disposition to riot; when the
friends of freedom were represented as having formed a design of
regulating markets, dividing farms, and equalising property; and
when the imbecile farmer credulously imbibed the representation,
the affiliated societies in this city published this resolve,
&lsquo;<i>That if any member should break the peace by the
violation of existing laws</i>, <i>he should not only be
excluded</i>, <i>but delivered up into the hands of
justice</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; No exclusion, however, has taken place
in consequence of this resolution; and the reason has been
obvious&mdash;there has been no offence.&nbsp; The traitorous
conspirators (so called) in this city can call upon the Right
Hon. W. Windham to bear testimony to their love of peace.&nbsp;
The opposition he experienced last July, he very well knows arose
from no personal disrespect, nor from any view of incompetency on
his part in point of talents, but from a love of peace and an
inveterate hatred of <a name="page639"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 639</span>this accursed war.&nbsp; Mr. Windham
very well knows, that when he appeared in the character of a true
patriot, when it was his creed that &lsquo;The influence of the
crown had <i>increased</i>, was <i>increasing</i>, and ought to
be <i>diminished</i>;&rsquo; when he avowedly acted as a spy on
the executive government; when he was found to be the vigilant
guardian of the life, liberty, and property of his constituents;
when no horrid imprecation from his all-erring lips had blasted
our commercial interests; when he had not learned to calumniate
his constituents and to impute the blackest crimes to the friends
of his country; when he had not apostatized from the sacred path
marked out by a Hampden&rsquo;s and a Sydney&rsquo;s blood; when
he had not frowned on freedom and preached the doctrine of
extermination, he was respected&mdash;yes, loved; at least by
one, who has offended his best friends, sacrificed his interest,
and endangered his life to procure his present elevation.&nbsp;
Mr. Windham knows that he was never despised by the Whig interest
in the city, till he appeared in the character of a war minister,
and the enthusiastic abettor of the most disgraceful and perilous
measures ever pursued by weak and wicked men.&nbsp; Perhaps Mr.
Windham may boast that his friends in Norwich are not diminished,
that he found as many last July as he was wont to find.&nbsp;
True, but where did he find them?&nbsp; Where public money had
paved his way!&nbsp; At the Back of the Inns, among
flannel-waistcoat manufacturers, in the precincts of the
Cathedral, and in many places and connexions where, on former
occasions, he would have been ashamed to have sought them.&nbsp;
Here are those who by the possession of places, contracts,
promises, expectations, and anticipations, are influenced to vote
for all the measures of government, right or wrong; and those
who, connected with the above description, are pleased with their
prosperity and rejoice to see them fatten, though on the public
spoil.</p>
<p><a name="page640"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
640</span>&ldquo;Those, too, are to be met with here, who under
the influence of superstition and prejudice tremble for the
safety of <i>Church and King</i>.&nbsp; Nor are we without those
brainless Gallios, by whom men and measures are never weighed;
who, devoid of sense and negligent of the means which might make
them wise, always see with the eyes of others, and bow obsequious
to their lordly wills.&nbsp; To the credit of the nation,
however, at the late election, a fifth class of citizens was
found, a class of freemen who, though called Jacobin levellers,
could not countenance a man of blood.&nbsp; These, averse to
coercive measures, averse to violence, averse to war, averse to
the annihilation of commerce, and alike averse to a
nation&rsquo;s ruin, turned their eyes to a friend of peace; and
in the person of Mr. Mingay found an unsullied blank, on which
770 freemen wrote their protest against the measures of the
administration, the commencement and continuance of a dreadful
war.&nbsp; Let me ask Mr. Windham, let me ask the world, who are
the best men, the advocates of negociation, who wish to overcome
evil with good, or those who destroy the world by casting about
firebrands, arrows, and death?&nbsp; If the former, I will then
assert that the reputed conspirators are of that description, and
deserve the character of the best of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the friends of freedom met to celebrate the
deliverance of the acquitted felons, had the duke of Portland
known their character, our present worthy mayor would have
received no orders from his grace&rsquo;s office to parade the
streets with constables to preserve the peace.&nbsp; Had no
curry-favour sycophant, no worthless candidate for the receiver
generalship, endeavoured to excite the jealousy of his grace, the
mayor would not have been necessitated to do what to him was
unpleasant, or of vindicating in his letter to the duke, which to
his honour he did, the injured character of his
fellow-citizens.</p>
<p><a name="page641"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
641</span>&ldquo;Thank God! the traitorous conspirators need no
militia, no barracks, no standing army, no royal proclamations,
no suspension of the Habeas Corpus, to keep them quiet.&nbsp; Men
of principle detest tumult; and in their love of order and of
peace, they find a restraint more powerful than any government
can impose.&nbsp; From their peaceful habitations the savage
whoop has not been heard; they have not assailed their quiet
neighbours, nor burnt the dwellings of God or man.&nbsp; But can
this be fairly said of their accusers?&nbsp; Have no anarchists,
rioters, and levellers been found among them? (alluding to events
at Birmingham).&nbsp; Ah! had that been happily the case, thy
streets, O Birmingham, had never been lighted by the
rioter&rsquo;s torch! nor Thy temples, blessed God, reduced to
ruins!&nbsp; Bigotry and persecution had not deprived us of the
most splendid talents, nor had philosophy been forced to seek an
asylum under calmer skies!&nbsp; Had the vain, the greedy, the
ambitious candidates for honour and emoluments in the army, the
navy, and the church been under the same influence that has
governed the hearts and directed the conduct of the friends of
freedom, the destroying sword had been lodged in its peaceful
scabbard, there to have slept an eternal sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The preacher proceeded in the same eloquent manner to denounce
the war and its advocates, and to defend the friends of freedom
and peace, who it appears were numerous in this city, and who
formed various associations of, what was deemed, a radical
character.&nbsp; The Tories also had their political clubs under
various names, and held weekly or monthly meetings at different
hotels or taverns.&nbsp; The Eldon Club, formed and named in
honour of Lord Eldon, is the only one that now remains, and the
members have long held <a name="page642"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 642</span>their meeting at the Bell Inn, on
the Castle Hill.&nbsp; For some years the growing feeling here in
favor of various pluses of reform, manifested itself chiefly in
contests for the representation of the city; but gradually,
public meetings and petitions to parliament became more and more
frequent, and during the few years which preceded the great
Reform Bill, were very numerous and often very excited.&nbsp;
Amongst the first subjects which called forth the indignant
protests of the citizens was that of the corn-laws.&nbsp; On Jan.
12th, 1815, a county meeting was held at the Shirehall, when it
was unanimously resolved to petition parliament to take the
corn-laws into consideration, on account of the depressed prices
of agricultural produce.&nbsp; The bill, fixing the protecting
price of wheat imported at 80s. per qr. and barley at 20s. per
coomb, was this session enacted.&nbsp; On February 8th, at a
numerous meeting held at the Guildhall, the mayor, (J. W.
Robberds,) presiding, it was resolved to petition the House of
Lords against the bill, which had then passed the House of
Commons.&nbsp; The petition was signed by 13,000 citizens, but it
passed the House of Lords, and received the royal assent.&nbsp;
Great excitement prevailed, and on March 17th, Thomas William
Coke, Esq. and Lord Albemarle, both Liberals, were attacked by
the populace, at the cattle show, and pelted with stones, in
consequence of the support which they had given to the
corn-laws.&nbsp; Fortunately, they escaped to the Angel Inn (now
the Royal Hotel), and afterwards from the city, but the tumult
raged so highly, that the riot act was read, and the Brunswick
Hussars were called out to quell the disturbance.</p>
<p><a name="page643"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 643</span>In
the following year (1816) the attention of the citizens was
turned to the question of Parliamentary Reform, and on the 14th
October, a common hall was held for the adoption of a petition in
its favour.&nbsp; Mr. Edward Taylor moved the adoption of the
petition, and after congratulating the meeting on having a
representative, in the person of Mr. Smith, who was an able and
constant friend of the liberties of the people and of
Parliamentary Reform, he reminded the audience that it was in
vain for members of parliament to attempt to stem the torrent of
corruption, unless the people supported them.&nbsp; The people
had been long inactive, but he hoped to see the spirit of zeal
and energy on behalf of this great cause revived, and extend
itself to the verge of the island; and that petitions on the same
principle as that about to be adopted by the present meeting
would be sent to the legislature from every part of the
kingdom.&nbsp; Mr. Firth had objected to the time as
inappropriate.&nbsp; This he (Mr. Taylor) regarded as the old
Pitt cant, according to which it always appeared that there were
two seasons when any attempt to reform parliament was improper;
the former of these was a state of war, when it was said that the
ministers had something else to do besides redressing public
grievances; the other was a state of peace, when the objection
was that, all things being quiet, it was best not to disturb
them.&nbsp; He (Mr. Taylor), however, affirmed that it was no
less the duty than the right of the people of this country to
call loudly for reform, especially at a time when their burdens
and distresses <a name="page644"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
644</span>were so great.&nbsp; Surely they were justified in
asking for retrenchment in the public expenditure, when Lord
Bathurst alone took more of the nation&rsquo;s money, than was
sufficient to maintain the poor of Norwich for a year.&nbsp;
There was a long black list exhibiting many more such; while, at
the same time, our trade was stagnant, and our poor rates
increasing; and, therefore, he asked boldly whether such persons
as these, who were taking the public money, ought not to be
called on to disgorge some of the plunder.&nbsp; The petition was
adopted by acclamation, and then Mr. William Smith, M.P., for
Norwich, addressed the audience, approving of its prayer.</p>
<p>Mr. E. Taylor attended many meetings elsewhere in favor of
Reform in Parliament.&nbsp; He took a very active part in local
politics and was the life and soul of his party at contested
elections, whether for the city or the council.&nbsp; He never
connived at bribery or any improper practices.&nbsp; On one
occasion, during the excitement of a parliamentary election, a
man named Bradfield, a working brazier, was offered &pound;30 to
vote &ldquo;orange and purple.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though sadly in want
of money, he steadily refused the tempting offer, which was
repeatedly pressed upon him, and he voted
&ldquo;blue-and-white!&rdquo;&nbsp; The result was that he lost
his employment, and fell into great distress.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor
having heard of the circumstance, interested himself on behalf of
the honest voter, and promoted a subscription, by means of which
he was furnished with tools, and enabled to begin successfully on
his own account.&nbsp; Many years afterwards, Mr. Taylor, meeting
him in <a name="page645"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
645</span>the street, offered him the usual greeting of a friend;
but Bradfield, fresh from his work, excused himself on the ground
that his hands were &ldquo;dirty.&rdquo;&nbsp; His generous
benefactor, however, would not allow the force of the apology,
declaring that the man&rsquo;s hands could not be very
&ldquo;dirty,&rdquo; his conduct had shown that his heart and
conscience were so pure.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor, in short, was so much
respected for his rectitude, both political and religious, that
it was no matter of surprise when he was seen walking arm in arm
with a political opponent.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s
electioneering labors were chiefly confined to serving on
committees, visiting clubs, canvassing voters, and haranguing the
people.&nbsp; He was a good speaker and always popular.&nbsp; On
the platform, his strong good sense and nervous eloquence
rendered his speeches effective, and they derived great weight
from the known integrity of his character.&nbsp; If elections
could have been gained by arguments alone, his addresses would
have been more formidable to his opponents than they were.&nbsp;
But there was often a majority, which could be won to either side
by &ldquo;golden&rdquo; arguments.</p>
<p>So matters went on till 1822, when many political meetings
were held, at which Mr. Edward Taylor took an active part.&nbsp;
On January 12th, he moved and carried a resolution for
Parliamentary Reform at a county meeting, convened for the avowed
object of considering &ldquo;agricultural distress.&rdquo;&nbsp;
On March 5th, he attended a Reform meeting at Bungay.&nbsp; On
April 24th, he attended another &ldquo;agricultural
distress&rdquo; meeting, and carried a resolution in favor of
Parliamentary <a name="page646"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
646</span>Reform.&nbsp; On May 11th, a county meeting was held
with the express object of petitioning for reform, and
resolutions were carried in favor of it.&nbsp; On Nov. 5th, Mr.
Taylor presided at the annual dinner of the Norwich Reform
Club.</p>
<p>The agitation for the repeal of the corn laws was continued in
1825, and on April 18th a public meeting was held in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, where a petition was adopted for a revision
of the corn laws, which afterwards received 14,385 signatures,
and was forwarded on the 26th to be presented to the House of
Commons.&nbsp; Meetings were also held in the same year to
promote the abolition of slavery, a question which excited a good
deal of interest in this city; while the years from 1826 to 1829
were devoted chiefly to agitations for the abolition of slavery
and Roman Catholic emancipation, counter petitions being sent to
parliament in regard to the latter by the Whig and Tory sections
of the clergy.</p>
<p>On June 29th, 1830, King William IV. was proclaimed, on the
Castle Hill, by the High Sheriff, the bells ringing in honour of
the event.&nbsp; Next day the king was proclaimed in the city,
amid the cheers of the citizens; and the mayor presided at a
dinner, in celebration of His Majesty&rsquo;s accession, at the
Norfolk Hotel.&nbsp; This king was believed to be in favour of
Reform and Retrenchment, and the liberal party always made him
appear to be so.&nbsp; But the correspondence of the late Earl
Grey with his Majesty, recently published, proves that the king
entertained the question of Reform with great reluctance, which
was <a name="page647"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
647</span>shared even by some of the Whig ministers.&nbsp; Lord
Grey himself wrote, January 16th, 1831,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It has often been my wish to find the means
of postponing it, but the result of all my consideration has been
that an attempt to do so would be fatal to the character of the
government, and would lead to its dissolution under circumstances
still more disastrous than those which would follow such a
result, if his Majesty were unfortunately compelled, by a sense
of duty, to withhold his assent from the measure which may be
submitted to him by his ministers.&nbsp; And other members of the
government itself interposed difficulties.&nbsp; Even Lord
Brougham objected, after the measure was drawn up, to the
abolition of the close boroughs, urging the argument that there
would be no means for getting seats for persons in the
government,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Lord Grey seriously feared that on this point his lord
chancellor might &ldquo;throw us over with the king!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The king would not hear of the ballot, and he strongly objected
to shortening the duration of parliament to five years as
proposed.&nbsp; At last all obstacles were removed, and on March
4th, 1831, the bill was introduced by Lord John Russell into the
House of Commons.&nbsp; After a prolonged debate it was read a
second time by only a majority of one.&nbsp; It was defeated in
committee on an amendment against diminishing the number of
English representatives.&nbsp; Then the cabinet, by a minute,
called on the king for a distinct answer to the request for a
dissolution.&nbsp; He yielded, avowing that the perils to follow
at home and abroad from a change of ministry were greater than
could arise from a dissolution.&nbsp; But he took occasion <a
name="page648"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 648</span>to recur to
some of his old objections, and to urge that the bill should be
remodelled before being re-introduced; and he pressed the
condition, above all, of resistance to extreme change.</p>
<p>In consequence of the dissolution on the defeat of ministers
on the Reform Bill, an election took place in this city on April
29th, 1831.&nbsp; The polling commenced next morning, Saturday,
and was continued on the following Monday and Tuesday.&nbsp; The
numbers were for R. H. Gurney, Esq., (<span
class="GutSmall">L.</span>) 2158; the Right Hon. Robert Grant,
(<span class="GutSmall">L.</span>) 2163; Sir Charles Wetherell,
(<span class="GutSmall">C.</span>) 977; and Mr. M. T. Sadler,
(<span class="GutSmall">C.</span>) 964.&nbsp; The two former
gentlemen were declared duly elected.&nbsp; On the Monday evening
the Tory polling booths were pulled down and afterwards
burned.</p>
<p>On February 29th, 1832, Lord Viscount Sidmouth presented an
address to the king, signed by 2300 of the gentry, clergy,
freemen, freeholders, and other inhabitants of the city, praying
his Majesty to &ldquo;withhold his royal sanction from any
measure which might compromise the independence of either branch
of the legislature, and expressing their fullest confidence in
his paternal regard for his faithful people to preserve the
fundamental principles of the British constitution.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This petition was in reference to a threatened creation of new
peers in the House of Lords.&nbsp; On May 14th, ministers having
been again defeated on the Reform Bill, (by a majority of
thirty-five in the House of Lords,) a requisition was presented
to the mayor, Sir J. H. Yallop, to call a public meeting in
support of the bill.&nbsp; The mayor complied, and the meeting <a
name="page649"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 649</span>was
called.&nbsp; A procession was formed on the Castle Meadow, and
being joined by a very large body from Wymondham, carrying many
banners and accompanied by bands of music, proceeded to St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, which was quite filled.&nbsp; The mayor
presided, and a petition was adopted praying the House of Commons
to stop all supplies till the bill was passed.&nbsp; The cry was
for &ldquo;the bill&mdash;the whole bill, and nothing but the
bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; On June 5th, the &ldquo;Telegraph&rdquo; coach
arrived in the city with the news of the passing of the Reform
Bill, by a majority of eighty-four.&nbsp; A large number of
people were in waiting, and the moment the coach entered the top
of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Street, the people on hearing the news
loudly cheered, and the cheering was continued along the whole
line of the street into the Market Place.&nbsp; A large party
perambulated the city with a band playing lively airs, all the
evening, and on the following night a bonfire was kindled on the
Castle Ditches.&nbsp; During the month several public dinners
were held to celebrate the passing of the Reform Bill; and the
5th of the following month was devoted to a special
demonstration.&nbsp; The morning was ushered in by the firing of
cannon and the ringing of bells, and a procession having been
previously arranged, about 11 a.m. a large body of horsemen took
up their position on the Castle Ditches whence, headed by three
mounted trumpeters, and followed by the Norwich Political Union
and electors of the different wards, and accompanied by an
immense concourse of spectators, they passed through the
principal streets of the city.&nbsp; The electors afterwards <a
name="page650"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 650</span>proceeded
to the Old Cricket Ground, where they were regaled with roast
beef, plum-pudding, and ale, and spent the rest of the day in
rural sports.</p>

<p>The first election for the city, after the passing of the

<p>The contest was a severe one, and the total number polled was
3807, including 2283 freemen, 834 freeholders, and 690
occupiers.&nbsp; Gross bribery prevailed, and a committee of
investigation was at once appointed, meetings were held, and
subscriptions were collected from house to house throughout the
several parishes, in support of a petition to parliament against
the return of the sitting members.&nbsp; The petition was
presented by Mr. Grote on the 18th of Feb., 1833, and on the 4th
of April, intelligence reached the city by mail that a committee
of the House had declared the members duly elected, but that they
had decided that the petition was neither frivolous nor
vexatious.&nbsp; At page 396 we have already given some of the
evidence afterwards taken in Norwich on the subject, by the
commissioners appointed to enquire into the state of the
municipal corporation.&nbsp; The decision of the parliamentary
committee was received with great <a name="page651"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 651</span>surprise.&nbsp; On June 19th of the
same year, the Conservative ladies of Norwich, having previously
subscribed for two banners to be presented to Lord Stormont and
Sir James Scarlett, the presentation took place in the Council
Chamber, in the presence of 150 ladies, with several members of
the corporation.&nbsp; Lord Viscount Stormont attended, and Mr.
Robert Scarlett was present on behalf of his father, Sir James
Scarlett.&nbsp; Mrs. Bignold, the mayoress, and Mrs. Preston
presented the banners amid great applause.</p>
<p>The first Reformed Parliament assembled January 29th,
1833.&nbsp; It lasted barely two years, for the dismissal of the
Whig ministry by the king, and the placing of Sir Robert Peel at
the head of a Conservative government, caused its dissolution on
December 10th, 1834.</p>

<p>The second Reformed Parliament assembled, Feb. 19th, 1835, and
on the 26th an amendment on the address led to a division with
the following result:&mdash;for the amendment 309; against 302;
majority against ministers, 7.&nbsp; This led to the resignation
of the Peel administration; and Lord Melbourne was recalled to

dissolution, on July 17th, 1837, and then followed the most

was reduced&mdash;Douro, 1842; Smith, 1841; Scarlett, 1840;

declared duly elected.</p>
<p>The third Reformed Parliament assembled on Nov. 15th, 1837,
and continued till June 23rd, 1841.&nbsp; Another election took
place on June 28th, 1841, when the former members were again
candidates.&nbsp; No polling took place at this election, but it
was rendered remarkable in consequence of the Chartists and other
electors being much opposed to the compromise, which the
exhausting contest of 1837 had induced the leaders of the Liberal
and Conservative parties to enter into, and an opposition of some
kind was resolved upon.&nbsp; Accordingly, after Lord Douro and
Mr. Smith had been nominated at the Guildhall, John Dover, a
stalwart Chartist freeman, proposed as a candidate, Mr. William
Eagle, a barrister of Lakenheath, in Suffolk.&nbsp; John Whiting,
a &pound;10-occupier, <a name="page653"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 653</span>seconded the nomination, and a show
of hands was taken, which the sheriff declared to be in favor of
Lord Douro and Mr. Smith.&nbsp; Then Dover demanded a poll for
Mr. Eagle, who was not present.&nbsp; The under-sheriff thereupon
required a guarantee for the expenses, and some delay
occurred.&nbsp; Many persons were applied to in the emergency,
but declined to give the guarantee required.&nbsp; Dover
ultimately withdrew the nomination on receiving &pound;50 from
certain parties, as he alleged, for expenses which had been
incurred.&nbsp; This soon became known to the crowd of Chartists
outside of the Guildhall, and a riot ensued.&nbsp; When Dover
came out they surrounded him, took his money from him, and tore
the clothes off his back.&nbsp; He escaped for the time, but on
the following day the mob found him again, and threatened to
throw him into the river, but he was rescued by the police.&nbsp;
A petition was subsequently presented, by Mr. Duncombe, to the
House of Commons, signed by 6000 inhabitants of Norwich,
complaining of the return of Lord Douro and Mr. Smith, but it led
to no result, and they sat in the house till the next
election.</p>
<p>The fourth Reformed Parliament assembled Aug. 19th, 1841, and
was dissolved July 23rd, 1847.&nbsp; Another election took place
on July 29th, 1847.&nbsp; A very great effort was made at this
election, by a large body of voters, to break down the compromise
which had been entered into in 1841; and though not successful,
it proved the difficulty of maintaining such an arrangement in a
large constituency.&nbsp; Mr. Parry, a Barrister of the Home
Circuit, was nominated by <a name="page654"></a><span

1865.&nbsp; The nomination for this city was appointed to take
place on Tuesday, July 11th.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>The Election of July</i>,
1865.</p>
<p>Mr. Warner and Sir William Russell offered themselves for
re-election.&nbsp; The Conservatives, however, undismayed by past
defeats, determined again to contest the representation.&nbsp; At
a large meeting of the party, held at the Norfolk Hotel on
Saturday evening, July 1st, Sir S. Bignold, who presided, after
opening the proceedings, introduced Robert Edmond Chester Waters,
Esq., of Upton Park, Dorsetshire, to the electors present, who
resolved unanimously to support him as one of the Conservative
candidates.&nbsp; At a meeting subsequently held in the third
ward, Augustus Goldsmid, Esq., was introduced and accepted as the
second candidate.&nbsp; The electors knew very little about the
antecedents of either gentlemen, and never supposed that Mr.
Waters had been a candidate in the Liberal interest, and a member
of the Reform Club.&nbsp; He was a young man and a good speaker,
and by his eloquence and address greatly pleased his numerous
supporters.&nbsp; On the Friday following, however, in the two
local Liberal newspapers, the <i>Norfolk News</i> and the
<i>Norwich Mercury</i>, and at a large meeting of Liberal
electors in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, certain serious charges were
made affecting the character of Mr. Waters, which charges, it was
alleged, had led to his &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; from the Reform
Club, of which he had once been a member; and the Conservatives
<a name="page658"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 658</span>were
challenged to investigate the truth of the charges.&nbsp; Mr.
Waters himself indignantly denied them, and issued a circular
stating that he had ordered legal proceedings to be instituted
against the authors of the slanders.&nbsp; He also addressed a
great meeting in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall in his own defence, and
vehemently denounced his calumniators.&nbsp; The challenge of the
Liberals was accordingly accepted, and Mr. H. S. Patteson and Mr.
E. Field were appointed on behalf of the Conservative committee
to accompany Dr. Dalrymple and Mr. J. H. Tillett to London, to
examine the books of the Reform Club, and make other
investigations.&nbsp; In the meantime the Conservative committee
issued an appeal to the electors, expressing themselves satisfied
with the proofs Mr. Waters had submitted to them of his position
in society, and asking them to suspend their judgment until the
return of the deputation from London.&nbsp; On the Monday, the
gentlemen forming the deputation proceeded to London, and in the
course of the day, a telegram, unfavourable to Mr. Waters, was
received by the committee in the city, which resulted in the
following notice being issued:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fellow Citizens</span>;
in consequence of a telegram just received, we feel it our duty
to withdraw our support from Mr. Waters, as one of the candidates
for the city.&nbsp; The other gentlemen who signed the previous
paper are absent from Norwich.&nbsp; Signed, Fred. Brown, J. B.
Morgan, F. E. Watson, Henry Ling.&nbsp; Norwich, 10th July,
1865.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As may be supposed, this telegram caused great consternation
among the Conservatives, many of whom <a name="page659"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 659</span>resolved to support Mr. Waters
notwithstanding.&nbsp; Indignation meetings of a large section of
the party were held at various taverns in the city, and Mr.
Waters was received with greater enthusiasm than ever.&nbsp; At a
meeting held in the evening, Mr. Waters addressed his friends,
and the Hon. Major Augustus Jocelyn also spoke, bearing testimony
to the high personal character of Mr. Waters.&nbsp; This only
confirmed the gentlemen of his committee in their previous
decision, whereupon Mr. Waters declared his determination to
stand independently, and he continued his candidature.</p>
<p>The nomination took place on Tuesday, July 11th, in the
Guildhall, which was crowded by partisans.&nbsp; The sheriff (C.
Jecks, Esq.) presided as returning officer.&nbsp; Sir William
Foster, Bart., nominated Edward Warner, Esq., of Higham Hall,
Woodford, Essex, as a fit and proper person to represent the city
of Norwich in parliament.&nbsp; Mr. E. Willett seconded and Mr.
J. J. Colman supported the nomination, amid much applause.&nbsp;
Dr. Dalrymple nominated Sir William Russell, Bart., C.B., of
Charlton Park, Gloucestershire; Mr. J. H. Tillett seconded and
Mr. Donald Steward supported the nomination.&nbsp; Mr. J. G.
Johnson nominated Augustus Goldsmid, Esq., Barrister-at-law; Mr.
Patteson seconded and Mr. J. B. Morgan supported the
nomination.&nbsp; Mr. R. P. Wiseman nominated Robert Edmond
Chester Waters, Esq., of Upton Park, Dorsetshire; Mr. J. Allen
(surgeon) seconded and Mr. John Hardy supported the
nomination.&nbsp; The sheriff then called for a show of hands,
and declared it to be in favour of Mr. Warner and Sir William <a

<p>The House of Commons, as organised in 1832, performed, during
the thirty-five years of its existence, a work of the first
magnitude, the repealing of the old and bad corn laws.&nbsp; It
also swept away the navigation laws, the paper and newspaper
taxes, the window duties, and every restriction which impeded the
progress of industry.&nbsp; But a new House of Commons was
needed, a House that should represent not only the middle but
also the working classes, not only capital but labour.&nbsp; For
this purpose, a new Reform Bill became necessary, to lower and
extend the franchise to all householders, to give at least every
rate-payer a vote, to enable working-men to help in returning
members to Parliament.&nbsp; After Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s death
a new government was formed; and in 1866, Mr. Gladstone brought
in another Reform Bill, which was not accepted, and on an adverse
division, respecting a rating clause, the ministry
resigned.&nbsp; Lord Derby came into office, and Mr. Disraeli
introduced a Bill for Household Suffrage, on terms based on
rate-paying by the occupiers.&nbsp; This Bill, which swept away
all &ldquo;compounding&rdquo; for rates, <a
name="page661"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 661</span>was passed
in 1867, and under it the number of voters in Norwich was
increased from five to twelve thousand.&nbsp; In 1868, ministers
were defeated by a majority of more than sixty, on a motion by
Mr. Gladstone for the dis-establishment and dis-endowment of the
Irish church, and the government determined to appeal to the new
constituency.</p>

<h4><i>The Election of Nov.</i>, 1868.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> consequence of the passing of
the New Reform Bill in 1867, this election had been long
anticipated, and preparations for it had been for some months in
progress by the re-organisation of the three parties&mdash;the
Conservatives, the Whigs, and the Radicals, the last of which was
now numerically the strongest of the three.&nbsp; At the
commencement of the year, a general committee of forty delegates,
five from each of the eight wards, was formed in the Tory
interest, in order to be prepared for the coming struggle.&nbsp;
This general committee, consisting of middle-class and
working-men, was intended to supersede a junta of the more
influential men of the party, who were accused of having
mis-managed every election for the last twenty years; and they
set to work at once to form a general Conservative Association,
and to some extent, succeeded, while the old leaders kept aloof
from all the proceedings, Mr. G. Johnson, Mr. E. Field, Mr. F. E.
Watson, Mr. J. S. Skipper, <a name="page663"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 663</span>Mr. F. Brown, Mr. J. B. Morgan, Mr.
H. Morgan, and others, who had been active partisans, seldom
putting in an appearance at any political meetings.&nbsp; After
re-organising their party, the new committee of forty cast about
for a popular candidate, and fixed upon Sir R. J. H. Harvey,
Bart., the late member for Thetford, which had just been
disfranchised, but after a long consideration of the matter he
politely declined, and though again and again solicited, he still
refused to come forward.&nbsp; After various fruitless
negociations with other parties, the new committee however at
last requested Sir Henry Stracey, Bart., of Rackheath, to contest
the representation of the city; and though he hesitated for some
time, at last he consented to do so, and issued a short
address.&nbsp; He attended many ward meetings of his party at
different places, and one great meeting in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Hall.&nbsp; Sir S. Bignold presided and spoke strongly in favour
of the hon. baronet, who declared himself to be a Protestant
churchman; a friend of church and state, and of all the
time-honoured institutions of the country; a supporter of
Disraeli&rsquo;s ministry; and an opponent of all radical
changes.&nbsp; Sir Henry also, by request, attended a meeting of
the Licensed Victuallers, at the Hop-Pole Gardens, and having
promised to oppose the Permissive Bill and to vote for a redress
of their grievances, the meeting passed a resolution to support
him at the coming election.</p>
<p>During the autumn, the Whigs held several meetings at the
Royal Hotel, and after much discussion resolved to support the
old members, Sir William <a name="page664"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 664</span>Russell and Mr. Edward Warner.&nbsp;
Those gentlemen accordingly came to Norwich by the invitation of
the Whigs and addressed the electors, but were not favourably
received by the meeting, most of those present being advanced
Liberals.&nbsp; In consequence of this, they retired till the
Liberals should be more united.&nbsp; The working-men, in fact,
had also held many previous meetings, and were resolved to have
their own candidate, and they nominated Jacob Henry Tillett, who
had laboured for them for so many years.&nbsp; To achieve their
end, they formed a very extensive Organization, embracing all the
wards in the city; canvassed the electors, and registered every
one in every parish who promised to vote for their candidate; and
in a short time they registered 4000 voters for Mr. Tillett, and
were very confident of success.&nbsp; The consequence was that
when Sir Henry Stracey came forward, the Whigs, in view of a
strong contest, agreed to combine with the advanced section of
the Liberals, and a meeting was held of both sections, who
resolved to support Sir William Russell and Mr. Tillett&mdash;Sir
William Foster, presiding.&nbsp; Those two gentlemen accordingly
issued a joint address, promising to support the same Liberal
principles and measures.&nbsp; The Conservatives too, in view of
the coming contest, forgot their past differences, and worked
together most energetically.</p>
<p>The nomination took place on November 16th.&nbsp; As soon as
the sheriff (J. Robison, Esq.) had taken his seat, the Guildhall
was filled with a roaring, shouting, and groaning crowd, who
exercised their <a name="page665"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
665</span>lungs most vigorously, to express their approval or
disapprobation of the views of the different prominent members of
either party, as they made their appearance by twos and threes at
the magistrates&rsquo; entrance to the court.&nbsp; For aught
that could be said to the contrary by those a few feet distant,
the reading of the writ and the administering of the oath to the
sheriff seemed to be but dumb show.</p>
<p>After the sheriff had opened the proceedings, Mr. H. Birkbeck
nominated Colonel Sir William Russell, Baronet.</p>
<p>Mr. John Youngs seconded and Mr. S. Daynes supported the
nomination.</p>
<p>Sir S. Bignold said he begged to nominate Sir Henry Josias
Stracey, Baronet, of Rackheath, their opulent neighbour and
brother elector.</p>
<p>Mr. W. J. U. Browne seconded and Mr. J. G. Johnson supported
the nomination.</p>
<p>Mr. J. J. Colman said he had great pleasure in nominating
Jacob Henry Tillett, Esq., of the city of Norwich.</p>
<p>Mr. A. M. F. Morgan seconded and Mr. C. J. Bunting supported
the nomination.</p>
<p>The sheriff, having read aloud the names of the candidates,
put them in the order of their nomination, and after taking the
show of hands on each, declared that it was in favor of Sir
William Russell and Jacob Henry Tillett, Esq.</p>
<p>Sir S. Bignold then demanded a poll on behalf of Sir H. J.
Stracey, and the proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to
the sheriff for presiding, <a name="page666"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 666</span>moved by Mr. J. G. Johnson, and
seconded by Mr. J. J. Colman.</p>
<p>The departure of the candidates from the Hall was witnessed by
some two thousand persons, who warmly greeted their respective
favorites.&nbsp; A very large crowd followed Mr. J. J. Colman and
Mr. Donald Steward to the Liberal head-quarters&mdash;the Royal
Hotel&mdash;cheering most enthusiastically for the Liberal
candidates.</p>
<p>The polling took place on the next day, and the following
shows the state of the poll as issued at intervals by the
Conservatives, from which it will be seen that, though Mr.
Tillett was at the bottom at four o&rsquo;clock, they themselves
show him to have had a majority of forty-seven votes, even so
late as half-past three, and that the Tory poll was increased in
the last half-hour by no fewer than 561!</p>

result of the polling was of course a terrible disappointment to
the Liberal candidates, and especially to Mr. Tillett&rsquo;s
friends, who had reckoned upon his return as certain.&nbsp; They
had not, however, anticipated the corrupt means which were
adopted to secure the return of Sir Henry Stracey.&nbsp; As soon,
however, as the contest was at an end, Mr. Tillett resolved to
petition against the hon. baronet&rsquo;s return, and the trial
took place in the Shirehall, before Mr. Baron Martin, on Friday,
Saturday, and Monday, the 15th, 16th, and 18th of January, and
ended in Sir Henry Stracey&rsquo;s election being declared void
on the ground of bribery by his agents.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The appeal to the country was made, it will be remembered, on
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s declared policy of dis-establishing the
Irish church, and the result of the general election showed so
decided a majority in Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s favor, that before
the new House of Commons assembled, Mr. Disraeli resigned, and
Mr. Gladstone assumed the reins of government.&nbsp; The House
met for the swearing in of members on the 10th of December; and
adjourned to February 16th, 1869, for the despatch of
business.</p>

684</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
The Mayors and Sheriffs of Norwich.</h3>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">LARGE</span> parchment book in the
Guildhall contains the names of all the mayors and sheriffs since
1403 when the first mayor was elected.&nbsp; The subjoined list
has been verified by that official document, and is the most
complete record ever published.&nbsp; We give also a few
particulars as to the residences of some of the most
distinguished of these civic dignitaries.</p>
<p>William Appleyard was the first mayor of Norwich, in
1403.&nbsp; He resided in an old flint building in Bridewell
Alley, St. Andrew&rsquo;s, which came afterwards into the hands
of Thomas Cambridge, who, in 1454, conveyed it to John Paston,
from whom it passed to the Hobarts, the Cursons, the Brownes, the
Codds, and the Sothertons.&nbsp; It was afterwards used as a
prison, and is now occupied by Mr. James Newbegin.</p>
<p>John Cambridge was elected to the office of mayor four times,
in 1430, 1437, 1438, 1439.&nbsp; He resided in one of the
old-fashioned houses on St. Andrew&rsquo;s hill.</p>
<p><a name="page685"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 685</span>Roger
Best, grocer, was elected mayor in 1467 and 1472.&nbsp; He
occupied a house in King Street, near St. Ethelred&rsquo;s
church.&nbsp; Afterwards, in the same house, lived Sir Robert de
Salle, who was killed by the rebels in Kett&rsquo;s
rebellion.</p>
<p>John Rightwise was elected mayor in 1501, and in 1504 was
chosen to represent the city in parliament.&nbsp; In 1513 he was
again elected mayor.&nbsp; He lived in the house in London Street
now occupied by Mr. Boulton, the ironmonger.&nbsp; During his
mayoralty he rebuilt the Market Cross, which formerly stood in
the Market Place.&nbsp; The cross contained an oratory
inside.&nbsp; At the time of the Commonwealth it was assigned to
dealers in leather, but was entirely demolished in 1732.</p>
<p>William Ramsey was sheriff in 1498, and mayor in 1502, and
again in 1508.&nbsp; He built a portion of St. Michael at Coslany
Church, and his tomb is on the north side with a merchant&rsquo;s
mark, and the initials &ldquo;W. R.&rdquo; on it.</p>
<p>John Clarke, mayor in 1515 and 1520, resided in a house on St.
Andrew&rsquo;s hill, occupied in 1561 by Mr. Suckling, merchant,
and sheriff of Norwich.&nbsp; The Suckling arms and many curious
carvings are still to be seen on the gateway.</p>
<p>Robert Jannys, whose portrait is in the Guildhall, was mayor
in 1517 and 1524.</p>
<p>Robert Browne, mayor in 1522, had his coat of arms painted on
the window of the Guildhall.</p>
<p>Augustine Steward was elected mayor in 1534, and represented
the city in parliament in 1541.&nbsp; He also <a
name="page686"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 686</span>served as
mayor in 1546 and 1556.&nbsp; He lived in a house on
Tombland.&nbsp; His portrait was placed in the Guildhall.</p>
<p>William Layer, mayor in 1537, occupied one of the large houses
on the north side of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Street.</p>
<p>Heny Bacon, grocer, was mayor in 1557 and 1566, and lived in a
flint house at the east end of the church of St. George&rsquo;s
Colegate; his mark and initials are over the door.&nbsp; Fifty
years ago, a large room on the first floor was lined with fine
oak panelling, and the chimney piece was elaborately
carved.&nbsp; These curiosities were removed to the mansion of G.
Kett Tompson, Esq., of Witchingham.&nbsp; The building is now a
boot and shoe warehouse.</p>
<p>Mr. Codd was mayor of Norwich in the year of Kett&rsquo;s
rebellion.&nbsp; He took an active part in suppressing the
rebellion, and at his death bequeathed a large sum of money to
the hospital in St. Helen&rsquo;s, where so many old men have
found an asylum.&nbsp; He was buried in the nave of the church of
St. Peter&rsquo;s per Mountergate, and the heads of his will are
read in the church annually on the Sunday before St.
Thomas&rsquo; Day.</p>
<p>William Mingay, mayor in 1561, entertained the Duke and
Duchess of Norfolk, and the Earls of Huntingdon and
Northumberland, with many of the nobility and gentry, at a grand
banquet in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, which, in subsequent years,
was the scene of many mayors&rsquo; feasts.</p>
<p>Alexander Thurston was mayor in 1600, and M.P. for Norwich in
1601.&nbsp; He lived in a large old-fashioned house in St.
Clement&rsquo;s churchyard, formerly occupied <a
name="page687"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 687</span>by the
priors of Ixworth.&nbsp; Some carved work in the house exhibits
the initials &ldquo;A. T.&rdquo; and the arms of Hester Aldrich,
his wife.&nbsp; In the adjoining house lived John Aldrich,
grocer, who took an active part in suppressing Kett&rsquo;s
rebellion.</p>
<p>John Pettus, mayor in 1608, was afterwards knighted.&nbsp; The
house at the north-west corner of St. Simon&rsquo;s churchyard
was long the residence of the Pettus family.&nbsp; The date 1608
is on the door with the arms of Pettus in one spandrel and his
wife&rsquo;s on the other.&nbsp; His monument is in St.
Simon&rsquo;s church.</p>
<p>Thomas Anguish, mayor in 1611, lived in a house at the north
end of Tombland.&nbsp; In a court there, on an old door, is the
date 1594 with the initials of himself and his wife, T. E.
A.&nbsp; He founded the Boys&rsquo; Hospital School in St.
Edmund&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He bequeathed a house and estate in
Fishgate Street to the corporation for the use and endowment of a
hospital, or a convenient place for keeping, bringing up, and
teaching very poor children born in the city.</p>
<p>Mr. John Harvey, manufacturer in 1709, was sheriff in 1720,
alderman in 1722, and mayor in 1727.&nbsp; He died on September
28th, 1742, and was buried in the family vault, which now
contains about forty leaden coffins, in the church of St.
Clement&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The family held an estate in that parish
for more than a century.&nbsp; Some of their portraits adorn the
walls of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.</p>
<p>John Patteson, mayor in 1788 and M.P. in 1806&ndash;7, resided
in a house on the right-hand side of a court adjoining the Crown
and Angel in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Street; afterwards he resided in
Surrey Street.</p>

<p>Alderman Moore was the last mayor, under the old corporation,
by the charter of which the chief magistrate was chosen out of
the twenty-four aldermen, by the freemen, on the first of May;
and sworn into office, on the Tuesday before the eve of New
Midsummer-day.</p>
<p>There were two sheriffs, one chosen by the court of
aldermen&mdash;the other by the freemen, on the last Tuesday in
August, and both sworn into office on New Michaelmas-day.</p>
<p>Under the Municipal Corporation Reform Act, the mayor and
sheriff are chosen by the sixteen aldermen and forty-eight
councillors, the former from amongst themselves, on the ninth of
November, and they enter upon their office on that day.</p>

706</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
Ecclesiastical.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> origin of the See of Norwich is
attached to Sigebert, king of the East Angles, who, being in
France about the year 630, brought over Felix, a priest of
Burgundy, and constituted him bishop, fixing his seat at Dunwich,
in Suffolk.&nbsp; About forty years afterwards the diocese was
divided, Dunwich and North Elmham having each a bishop, and this
continued till the year 870, when the two sees were again united
under Wybred at Elmham.&nbsp; Owing to the devastations of the
piratical Danes the see remained vacant nearly one hundred years,
but was restored by Theodored, in 995 according to the common
account; but there is evidence which tends to prove that he was
bishop in 945, if not before.&nbsp; During the reign of William
I. the see was removed to Thetford, and in the year 1094 it was
finally settled in Norwich.&nbsp; This added greatly to the
importance of the city, and made it the capital of East
Anglia.</p>
<p>The diocese, as to its seat, has continued unchanged since
1094, and as to its extent and government has been but slightly
modified.&nbsp; The most prominent <a name="page707"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 707</span>bishops have been Losinga, who
established the see at Norwich and founded the cathedral, and
John Grey or Gray, who governed Ireland, divided it into
counties, placed it under English laws, fought in France, and
captured fortresses there,&mdash;for bishops were fighting men in
those days; Pandulph, who excommunicated King John Lackland; W.
Middleton, who acted as Guardian of the Kingdom; John Salmon and
William de Ermine, who were Lord Chancellors; and Bateman, who
founded Trinity Hall, Cambridge.&nbsp; Others less noted were
Henry le Spencer, who fought as a soldier for the pope on shore,
and as an English admiral at sea; Richard Courtenay, who died at
the siege of Harfleur; John de Wakering, who was Lord Privy Seal;
Nykke, known as the blind bishop, who conducted a traitorous
correspondence with the pope; William Rugge, who deprived the see
of its barony; Parkhurst, who was famous for entertaining Oxford
scholars; Scambler, called &ldquo;the scandalous;&rdquo; John
Jeggon, called &ldquo;the wag;&rdquo; Montague, called &ldquo;the
excellent;&rdquo; Corbet, called the &ldquo;merry wit;&rdquo;
Hall, &ldquo;the saintly;&rdquo; Overall and Sparrow, &ldquo;the
learned;&rdquo; and Bathurst, &ldquo;the good,&rdquo; who pleaded
for Catholic emancipation.&nbsp; Three of the dignitaries, J.
Harpsfield, H. Prideaux, and T. Sherlock, became cardinals; one,
John, became archbishop of Smyrna; and one, Montgomery, became
bishop of Meath.</p>
<p>The cathedral establishment includes the bishop, the dean,
three archdeacons, four canons, twenty-four hon. canons, four
minor canons, and a chancellor.&nbsp; The income of the bishop is
&pound;4,500; that of each of <a name="page708"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 708</span>the archdeacons is &pound;200; and
that of the other archdeacon is &pound;184.&nbsp; The diocese
comprises all Norfolk except the parishes of Emneth and Brandon,
and all Suffolk except the deaneries of Thedwaster and Thingoe,
and parts of the deaneries of Clare, Fordham, and Sudbury; and it
is divided into the archdeaconries of Norwich, Norfolk, and
Suffolk.&nbsp; Population, 743,000; acres, 1,994,535; deaneries,
41; benefices, 908; curates, 253; church sittings, 294,177.&nbsp;
A few more particulars may be stated respecting some of the
earlier prelates.</p>

722</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
Religious, Educational, &amp; Benevolent.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Nearly</span> all of the Religious
Institutions in Norwich have arisen during the present century,
and annual meetings are held on their behalf.&nbsp; But the Bible
Society, the most important of them all, has been supported by
both Churchmen and Dissenters.&nbsp; It was founded in 1811,
since which year it has distributed 323,000 bibles in the city
and county, and remitted to the Parent Society more than
&pound;120,000.&nbsp; The late J. J. Gurney was an ardent
supporter of this society, and delivered his last great speech on
its behalf at an annual meeting in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.</p>
<p>Of the other societies the Church Missionary Society has taken
the lead, and the Lord Bishop of the diocese has generally
presided.&nbsp; This society was instituted here in 1813, and it
has raised more than &pound;70,000.&nbsp; The Rev. Edward
Bickersteth, one of its founders and its first secretary, was
partner with Thomas Bignold, Esq., solicitor of this city
(brother to Sir Samuel Bignold), whose sister he married.&nbsp;
At the first meeting in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, upwards of
&pound;700 was collected.&nbsp; Mr. Bickersteth was ordained in
1815 by Bishop Bathurst, and after visiting Africa on <a
name="page723"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 723</span>behalf of
the mission, became secretary of the Parent Society.</p>
<p>The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts
is, however, the oldest missionary society of the Church of
England, and annual meetings on its behalf have been held here
all through the present century.&nbsp; It has two objects in
view&mdash;first, by carrying the gospel to our colonists to
prevent christians from becoming heathens in faith and practice;
second, to make heathens christians.&nbsp; The work of the
society has been chiefly in our colonies.&nbsp; In following the
direction of its original charter, the society has been
vindicated by the practice of other more recent missionary
societies of the Church of England.</p>
<p>The Church Pastoral Aid Society was instituted in the year
1835, for the purpose of supplying assistance to the incumbents
of large and populous parishes, to enable them to obtain the help
of additional curates and lay agents.&nbsp; Aid is now afforded
to 548 incumbents, and the grants of the society, when all
occupied, are for 502 curates and 181 lay assistants.&nbsp;
Meetings are held here every year in support of the parent
institution.&nbsp; The total receipts for the year ending March
31st, 1868, were &pound;57,019 16s. 7d., and the expenditure
&pound;64,065 16s. 3d.</p>
<p>The Norwich Diocesan Church Association was established in
1862.&nbsp; Its object was to combine, as far as possible,
Churchmen of every shade of political and religious opinion in
the support of the established church, particularly as regards
all questions affecting its welfare, likely to become the subject
of legislation, <a name="page724"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
724</span>and generally in the promotion of measures calculated
to increase its stability and usefulness; but points of doctrine
are never brought under discussion.&nbsp; Annual meetings are
held every year on the second Thursday after Easter, when reports
are read, and the officers and committee elected.&nbsp; This
society comprises 800 members, one half of whom are laymen.</p>
<p>The Norwich Diocesan Church Building Association was
established on October 20th, 1836.&nbsp; It is in union with the
Incorporated Society for promoting the enlargement, building, and
repairing of churches and chapels in England and Wales.&nbsp; The
patron is the Earl of Leicester, and the president the Lord
Bishop of the diocese.&nbsp; Grants have been made to many
parishes in this county.</p>
<p>The Norfolk Book Hawking Association was established in
December, 1855, for the sale, throughout the county of Norfolk,
by the agency of licensed hawkers, of bibles, prayer books,
tracts, and prints of a religious and instructive
character.&nbsp; In the year ending August 31st, 1868, the number
of bibles, testaments, prayer books, church services, tracts, and
prints sold, amounted to 11,449, the receipts being &pound;523
1s. 11&frac12;d.&nbsp; The receipts for the year (including a
balance of &pound;56 2s. 5d.,) were &pound;759 18s. 4d., and the
expenditure amounted to &pound;722 9s. 1&frac12;d., leaving a
balance in hand of &pound;37 9s. 2&frac12;d.&nbsp; President, the
Lord Bishop of the diocese.</p>
<p>The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge was founded in
the year 1698.&nbsp; The Norwich Auxiliary is of later
date.&nbsp; During the year 1868 the committee <a
name="page725"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 725</span>forwarded
to the Parent Society contributions amounting to &pound;154, in
addition to donations of &pound;30 from the local fund; and the
sale of books at the depository realised &pound;350, viz., for
bibles and testaments, 1,489; prayer books, 3,731; other books,
16,993; total, 22,213.&nbsp; By the rules of this society all its
members must be of the established church.&nbsp; Its principal
object is the distribution of the Holy Scriptures at home and
abroad, and other religious books which are calculated to diffuse
christian knowledge.</p>
<p>The Norwich Churchman&rsquo;s Club was instituted in the early
part of the year 1868, mainly through the exertions of the Rev.
F. Meyrick, for the moral and mental improvement of young men in
the city.&nbsp; For these purposes a reading room has been
established, supplied with books, periodicals, and
newspapers.&nbsp; Lectures are delivered and classes have been
formed for secular and religious instruction.&nbsp; About 100
honorary, and 200 reading-room members have been enrolled.</p>
<p>Annual meetings have also been held here on behalf of the
London Missionary Society, which is chiefly supported by
Independents; on behalf of the Baptist Missions, the Wesleyan
Missions, and other missions to the heathen; the Society for
Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews; and also on behalf of
the Norwich City Mission, a society which has been of great
benefit in improving the spiritual condition of the poor.&nbsp; A
full account of the operations of this mission would exhibit the
social state of the city far better than any elaborate
description.</p>
<p><a name="page726"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
726</span>Turning our attention now to the question of Education,
it will not be too much to say that Norwich has always been the
head quarters of education in the eastern counties, on account
both of the number and the character of the schools, some of
which have produced very eminent men.&nbsp; The Grammar School is
a far-famed ancient institution.&nbsp; It was originally founded
and endowed by the bishops of the See who collated the masters,
and the archdeacon of Norwich inducted them.&nbsp; The Singing
and Grammar Schools belonging to the Convent were kept in the
Almonry, the masters of which were frequently collated by the
bishop on the Convent&rsquo;s nomination, and as soon as inducted
they generally published the bishop&rsquo;s inhibition,
prohibiting all other persons from teaching grammar or singing in
the city.&nbsp; At the Reformation they were dissolved; and the
present Free Grammar School was appointed, and took the name of
Edward VI.&nbsp; It is divided into the upper and lower schools,
has considerable endowments, and an interest in fifteen
scholarships at Cambridge.&nbsp; It has afforded instruction to
many distinguished scholars, including Archbishop Parker, Bishops
Cousin, T. Green, Maltby, and Monk, Dr. Caius, the founder of
Caius College at Cambridge, Wild, the learned tailor, Admiral
Lord Nelson, Coke, Rajah Brooke, and many others.&nbsp; The
Commercial School, in Bridge Street, shares the same endowments,
and affords instruction to more than 200 boys.</p>
<p>The report of the Schools Inquiry Commission, which was issued
in March, 1868, and is the most comprehensive on the subject of
the education of the <a name="page727"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 727</span>upper and middle classes that has
yet appeared, is very favourable as regards the Norwich Grammar
and Commercial Schools, but quite the reverse respecting the
schools in the county.&nbsp; Norwich Grammar School is stated to
have been established in 1547.&nbsp; The gross income of the
charity is &pound;1558.&nbsp; The endowment of the school is
&pound;662.&nbsp; The course of instruction is classical, under a
head master and competent teachers.&nbsp; This is no doubt the
best school for the classics, but the Commercial School is the
most useful to the citizens.</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond, the assistant commissioner, in the report upon
endowed schools says, that no education, preparatory to the
University, is supplied in Norfolk, except at the Grammar Schools
of Norwich, Holt, and King&rsquo;s Lynn, in none of which does
it, except in Norwich, &ldquo;engross very much of the
teacher&rsquo;s time and attention, nor is it anywhere carried
out to the same perfection as at such schools as Marlborough
College and the City of London School.&nbsp; In Norfolk, Latin,
so far as it went, was in the endowed schools generally
satisfactory.&nbsp; But hardly any boy could have been set to
write five consecutive lines of Latin, not taken from the
exercise book.&nbsp; It is fair to add that Norwich sacrifices
nothing to it.&nbsp; In mathematics, modern languages, and
general literature, the school has few equals; and certainly none
superior in the county.&nbsp; French is in Norfolk a recognised
study in classical schools, as well as in most of the
semi-classical schools; is very good, and in all but one
satisfactory.&nbsp; In the non-classical schools, French, <a
name="page728"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 728</span>when
attempted, is worthless.&nbsp; Arithmetic is in the great
majority of Norfolk schools practically, and perhaps
educationally, the most important subject taught, and a large
portion of time and attention is assigned to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only at a few schools is any useful knowledge of Algebra
given, and only at Norwich Grammar School does it extend beyond
the solution of quadratic equations.&nbsp; Euclid is not learnt
in a very satisfactory manner; it is taught too exclusively by
papers in Norfolk.&nbsp; Of natural science no real or
substantial knowledge is imparted.&nbsp; Of English subjects,
history is the least taught and the worst learnt.&nbsp; English
literature is hardly taught at all, yet it is the noblest
literature in the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond says that in Norfolk it is simply impossible to
establish a classical day school without boarders.&nbsp; At
Norwich, Yarmouth, and possibly Kings Lynn, semi-classical day
schools might, under very favourable circumstances, remunerate an
able certificated teacher, but no private day school in these
towns is any better than a national school; <i>a fortiori</i>,
this is true of smaller towns and villages.</p>
<p>The Boys&rsquo; and Girls&rsquo; Hospital Schools were
founded, in 1618, by Thomas Anguish; admit on the foundation
sixty-nine boys and fifty girls; allow to each boy &pound;10
yearly for board with parents or friends; the girls are boarded
and lodged at the new School Rooms in Lakenham.&nbsp; The schools
have an endowed income of &pound;2,097 in the boys&rsquo;
department, and &pound;1,012 in the girls&rsquo;
department.&nbsp; Baron&rsquo;s School has an endowed income <a
name="page729"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 729</span>of
&pound;536.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s School has &pound;137;
Balderstone&rsquo;s School has also &pound;137; Norman&rsquo;s
School has &pound;650, and maintains thirty boys; and several
other schools have endowments.&nbsp; The Lancasterian School, in
College Court, has room for 300 children, and is supported by
Nonconformists.&nbsp; The School for the Blind, in Magdalen
Street, was founded in 1805 at a cost of &pound;1,000, and has an
income of &pound;1,300 yearly, and is open to the blind from
every part of the kingdom.</p>
<p>The Norwich Diocesan National School Society, established in
1812, has contributed &pound;250 per annum towards the support of
schools in the city and county, and has supported an institution
for training mistresses for the charge of schools.&nbsp; These
trained teachers have been in great demand all over the
diocese.&nbsp; The Norwich charity schools are church schools,
nine in number, and they have afforded instruction to a large
number of boys and girls.&nbsp; But the education of the poor in
this city has not been left entirely to the church, as there are
many British schools supported by all classes of
Nonconformists.</p>
<p>In early times the monks or the clergy were the
schoolmasters.&nbsp; Their schools, when not carried on within
the walls of a monastery, were, and have been called, Grammar
Schools, up to the present time.&nbsp; Other similar schools have
also been established from time to time in various parts of the
district, some for educating the sons of the poor, and others for
the middle classes.&nbsp; The population of the country, however,
increased so rapidly, and the people were so <a
name="page730"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 730</span>ignorant,
that no comparison can be made with the present state of
society.&nbsp; Dr. Bell introduced the monitorial system, in
1796, and warmly advocated its adoption as the most effectual
means of rapidly extending popular instruction.&nbsp; It was as
warmly received, and he was chiefly instrumental in establishing
the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in
the principles of the Established Church.&nbsp; This society was
started in 1811, and has been very successful.&nbsp; The British
and Foreign Society was established shortly before upon the
principles advocated by Lancaster, of allowing the bible to be
read in the schools without note or comment.</p>
<p>A great change has taken place as regards the intelligence and
morals of the people, and this may be attributed to the vast
increase in the number of day and Sunday schools.&nbsp; Popular
education is almost the creation of the present century, although
the day-school epoch may be dated from the year 1796, when the
youthful quaker, Joseph Lancaster, began to teach children in his
father&rsquo;s house at Southwark.&nbsp; Lancaster was an
enthusiast in his calling, and acted as much in the character of
a guardian to his scholars as a master, and whilst often charging
nothing for his instruction, he fed his pupils as well.&nbsp; No
wonder that he had at one time 1000 scholars.</p>
<p>According to the census of 1851, the city contained then 45
public day schools, with 5,207 scholars; 10 private day schools,
with 2,553 scholars; and 55 Sunday schools, with 6,859 scholars,
which number <a name="page731"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
731</span>has since been very greatly increased.&nbsp; About
twenty-nine of the Sunday schools, with 2,650 scholars, belonged
to the Church of England; and twenty-six Sunday schools with more
scholars belonged to the Dissenters.&nbsp; Five schools with 534
scholars were endowed schools; thirteen with 1,915 scholars were
church schools; ten with 712 scholars were national schools; five
with 546 scholars were dissenting British schools.&nbsp; All the
rest belonged to the Non-conformists.</p>
<p>According to the census of 1861, the Norwich Parochial Charity
Schools afforded instruction, on the national system, to more
than 700 boys and 400 girls.&nbsp; The Model School for boys
numbered 400, and that for girls 300 scholars.&nbsp; New
schoolrooms had been built in Heigham, Lakenham, Thorpe, and
various parts of the city; and the bishops, the clergy, and
ministers of all denominations zealously promoted the educational
movement.&nbsp; A great change has, as might consequently have
been expected, taken place for the better as regards the morals
and intelligence of the mass of the citizens, and this may be
attributed in a great measure to the number of day and Sunday
schools.&nbsp; Crimes are not now of so frequent occurrence as
formerly.&nbsp; The magistrates and police have less to do; and
churches and chapels are more numerous, and better filled and
supported.</p>
<p>While the population has been increasing and schools becoming
more numerous in this city, some means of continuing the
education of young men seemed to be required, and this want has
been in a measure <a name="page732"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
732</span>supplied by the establishment of popular literary
institutions.&nbsp; Of these there have been several at various
periods, including the Mechanics&rsquo; Institution, the
Athen&aelig;um, the People&rsquo;s College, and the Young
Men&rsquo;s Institute, all of which are now defunct, and in their
places we have a Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association, and a
Church of England Young Men&rsquo;s Association; the former
having about 400 and the latter 200 members.&nbsp; Of both of
these the object is to promote the religious, moral, social, and
intellectual well-being of young men, and we are happy to be able
to say that their work is most energetically and efficiently
accomplished.&nbsp; There are also a School of Art and a Free
Library, both of which we have already noticed at pages 431 and
432.</p>
<p>As might also be expected, the growth of education and the
spread of religion have led to that which always, sooner or
later, comes out of the improved intellectual and moral condition
of society&mdash;the establishment of a large number of
benevolent institutions with various noble purposes.&nbsp;
Perhaps it would be quite within the bounds of the strictest
truth to say that there is hardly a city or town in the kingdom,
of the same population and extent as Norwich, in which a greater
amount of genuine charity exists, and where institutions for the
relief and comfort of the sick and the poor are more
abundant.&nbsp; In fact these are so numerous in Norwich that we
cannot even mention them.&nbsp; We may say, however, that amongst
them are the Norwich District Visiting Society for relieving the
sick poor at their own houses, established at a <a
name="page733"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 733</span>public
meeting held on January 16th, 1815; the Norwich Public
Dispensary, instituted in the year 1804, for the purpose of
giving advice, medicine, and attendance free of expense to
indigent persons unable to pay for the same; the Jenny Lind
Infirmary for sick children, established on May 30th, 1853, by
the proceeds of a concert, when the Swedish Nightingale was the
principal vocalist; the Benevolent Association for the relief of
decayed tradesmen, their widows and orphans, established here on
November 16th, 1790; the Norwich Magdalen or Female Home,
established in 1826, for the reclamation of females who have
deviated from the paths of virtue; the Orphans&rsquo; Home,
established in 1849, for training orphan girls for domestic
service; the Soup Charity, established in 1840, for supplying the
poor with a nutritious soup at a low price in winter; the Bethel
Hospital, erected in 1713, for the support and treatment of poor
lunatics at a very moderate charge; the Blind Hospital, founded
in 1805 by Thomas Tawell, a blind gentleman, for teaching the
blind to read and work; the Old Man&rsquo;s or St. Giles&rsquo;
Hospital in Bishopgate Street, founded by Edward VI. as an
almshouse; Doughty&rsquo;s Hospital in Calvert Street, founded by
William Doughty, gentleman, in 1687, for twenty-four poor men and
eight poor women; and, most valuable of all, the Norfolk and
Norwich Hospital for the relief of sick and lame poor.&nbsp; This
last, in fact, is an institution of such importance, and is
accomplishing so important a use, that we deem it deserving of a
more extended notice.&nbsp; This noble institution is an
extensive brick <a name="page734"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
734</span>building situated on St. Stephens Road.&nbsp; It was
erected in 1771 at a cost of more than &pound;21,000, including
about &pound;8,000 expended on subsequent additions and
improvements.&nbsp; It has been considerably enlarged at
different times, and it is fitted up with all the latest
improvements.&nbsp; It was commenced by the voluntary
contributions of the benevolent, and has received many donations
and legacies.&nbsp; It has been well supported by a long list of
annual subscribers.&nbsp; In 1867 the annual subscriptions
amounted to &pound;2038 14s. 0d.; benefactions, &pound;422 3s.
4d.; collections, &pound;313 1s. 7d.; legacies, &pound;124 4s.
10d.; dividends and interest, &pound;745 15s. 1d.; sundries,
&pound;62 0s. 4d.; total, &pound;3785 19s. 2d.&nbsp; The
expenditure in that year amounted to &pound;4935 9s. 3d.&nbsp;
The stock purchased since 1770 amounts to &pound;23,976 12s.
7d.&nbsp; The stock sold since 1770, &pound;4890 4s. 4d.&nbsp;
Present stock, &pound;22,091 9s. 5d.&mdash;3 per cents.&nbsp;
Bank stock, &pound;166 13s. 4d.&nbsp; From 1824 to 1864 the
institution received &pound;6018 1s. 9d. from the profits of the
Triennial Festivals in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; From the
opening of the hospital in 1772 to January 1st, 1868, in-door
patients 56,828, out-door 52,387.&nbsp; Daily average number of
in-patients, 133; average number of days of each, 43.&nbsp; The
physicians and surgeons attend in turn to take in-patients every
Saturday at 11 a.m., and every Wednesday at the same hour to
prescribe for the out-patients, gratuitously.</p>
<p>The affairs of the institution are superintended by a board of
management, selected annually from the governors, who consist of
persons who have contributed thirty guineas or upwards at one
time; and that the <a name="page735"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
735</span>institution is managed well is sufficiently attested by
the vast amount of good which, through a long series of years, it
has successfully effected, and the cordial support which it has
uniformly received from the nobility, gentry, and trading
community of both city and county.&nbsp; Doubtless it is a noble
exemplification of true Christian Charity, and it is earnestly to
be hoped that as years pass on its means of usefulness will be
more and more extended by the increasing sympathy and support of
an appreciative public.</p>

<h3><a name="page740"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 740</span>THE
ORWELL WORKS, IPSWICH.</h3>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Orwell Works, Ipswich, where
from 1000 to 1100 men and boys are constantly employed, are
situated on the edge of the Wet Dock, to which they have a
frontage of 935 feet, the largest dock frontage in the possession
of any private trading company in the United Kingdom.&nbsp; The
Great Eastern Railway runs into the yards, and goods may be
packed in the Orwell Works yard and delivered at any place having
railway communication with London without unloading.</p>
<p>The works occupy twelve acres of ground, of which about
two-thirds is roofed over, and the demand for covered space
continually increases.&nbsp; From 5,000 to 6,000 tons of complete
machinery, chiefly for agricultural uses, annually leave the
works.&nbsp; These, if placed side by side and close together,
would cover at least ten acres.&nbsp; These machines go to all
parts of the world.&nbsp; Orders have been executed for almost
every country in Europe, for North and South America, for Persia,
India, the Spice Islands, Australia, Africa, and other
countries.&nbsp; The catalogues and price currents of the firm
have been printed in many languages of the Old and the New
World.</p>
<p>The factory is divided into two parts by a road leading direct
into the Quay.&nbsp; On the southern side are situated the
Foundry, Smith Shops, Plough Shops, and Stores.&nbsp; Whilst on
the northern side are the Engine-Erecting Shop, Thrashing Machine
Shop, and other shops for the construction of Mills and smaller
agricultural machines, such as Screens, Grinding Mills,
Chaff-Cutters, Turnip-Cutters, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The foundry is large and well furnished with cranes and the
other appliances of the moulders&rsquo; art&mdash;especially with
patent machinery for moulding, by which an extraordinary rate of
production and of accuracy is secured.&nbsp; The smithy contains
73 forges, and nearly in the centre there is fixed one of
Nasmyth&rsquo;s large steam hammers.</p>
<p>Ploughs, for which this firm have so long been famous, are
fitted up in a large shop, after the forgings and castings have
been prepared in the smithy and foundry.&nbsp; Every plough
turned out, and which are numbered by thousands in the course of
one year, come under the eye of the foreman or inspector, and are
thoroughly examined, to see that every part is correct.&nbsp;
Here also are made Horse Rakes, Haymakers, and other field
implements.</p>
<p>In the northern block are fixed the valuable engineers&rsquo;
tools, lathes, stoking machines, &amp;c., necessary for the
turning, shaping, and fashioning all the component parts of a
steam-engine or other complex machine.&nbsp; Here also the
patterns are made, and here the produced machine receives its
final perfection.&nbsp; At the extreme <a
name="page741"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 741</span>northern
end of the factory are the shops where are made the steam
thrashing and other agricultural machines, of which wood is a
principal component, the wood-work being conveniently introduced
into this shop from a detached timber yard, where is fixed all
the wood-working machinery by which the frameworks of the steam
thrashers and other machines are completely fashioned.</p>
<p>In between the northern and southern parts of the Works the
Offices are situated, and it will give <i>some</i> idea of the
magnitude of the business when we say that last year upwards of
34,000 letters were received and answered.&nbsp; The Commercial
Office is 100 feet long, and the manufacturing office 40 feet
long.</p>
<p>Our remaining space must be devoted to the productions of the
firm.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the name of Ransome has been associated
with the plough from the earliest period of its improvement until
its present highly perfected condition, and that in many a
well-contested struggle in England and abroad, before all kinds
of tribunals, the Ransome plough has been eminently successful,
and is manufactured in annually increasing numbers.</p>
<p>The first great improvement in the plough, viz., the Patent
Chilled Plough Share was the invention of Robert Ransome, the
founder of the firm, and was patented in 1803.&nbsp; <i>Now</i>
these patent shares are in universal use.&nbsp; Indeed to the
improvement of the plough and the unwearied energy of the founder
and his two sons, James and Robert Ransome, the firm may be said
to owe its origin and subsequent success.</p>
<p>Messrs. Ransomes were also one of the earliest makers of the
portable steam engine, and are at the present time amongst the
largest producers of this very important machine in the
kingdom.&nbsp; Within the last ten years, engines of this class,
to the aggregate power of 10,000 horses nominal, have left the
Orwell Works.</p>
<p>The steam thrashing machines made by the firm, which possess
peculiar advantages of construction, are also produced in very
large numbers, and have carried off a large number of prizes.</p>
<p>To the merits of these and other inventions developed and
manufactured by the firm, the long line of prize diplomas in the
commercial office, the large box of medals, gold, silver, and
bronze, the decorations bestowed on partners of the firm by the
Sultan of Turkey and the King of Portugal, and, recently, the
gold medal of the Paris Exhibition, bear abundant testimony and
need no confirmation of ours.</p>
<p>We may just add that the manufacture of railway material,
which has formed part of the business hitherto conducted at the
Orwell Works, will shortly be transferred to a branch of the old
firm, who are building a new factory on the banks of the
Orwell.&nbsp; This will give Messrs. Ransomes, Sims, and Head,
increased space, and facilities for the manufacture of
agricultural machinery, to which they will henceforth give their
exclusive attention.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
